# tgui-window

Citadel's in-house webpack hell!

Packages everything needed for the tgui_window system, which is something not necessarily even used for tgui itself!

This way we can have custom baseline html's that can be sent as a single asset, including potentially prebaking things like the statpanel and chat.
