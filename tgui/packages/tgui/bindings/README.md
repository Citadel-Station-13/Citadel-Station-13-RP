## Struct Datums

Format: It goes under `datum/`, and will be named `Game_CamelCasePath`.

This is only for 'struct' datums without many subtypes.

Example:

`/datum/loadout_item` becomes `datum/Game_LoadoutItem.ts`

Do not be fancy, just do it.

## Asset Pack JSON's

Example:

`/datum/asset_pack/json/character_setup`'s contents should be defined in `asset_packs/Pack_CharacterSetup`
