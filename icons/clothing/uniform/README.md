## Hierarchy
- /icons
  - /clothing
    - /uniform - << YOU ARE HERE
      - /casual - casual clothing like t-shirts, pants, etc. if it does not fit in any of the other categories it likely goes here.
      - /costumes - vanity costumes like kilts, mime outfits, clown outfits, cueball outfits, etc
      - /formal - formalwear like suits, dresses, fancy clothes etc. If the item is meant to be a standard uniform for a job put it in workwear
      - /workwear - Clothing intended to be worn for a job like jumpsuits, uniforms, etc. Anything that spawns for a job or on station will likely go here.


## Avoid going more than one folder deeper
- In the interest of keeping this system readable and maintained well into the future avoid going more than one folder deeper than the casual/costume/formal/workwear folders.
- If your folder is getting too big divide it into additional folders on the same level
- If the items are still related name them so that they are kept together when sorted alphabetically e.g. /workwear/jumpsuits, /workwear/jumpsuits_dept
