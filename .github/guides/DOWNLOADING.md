## DOWNLOADING
There are a number of ways to download the source code. Some are described here.

Option 1: The more complicated and easier to update method is using git.
You'll need to download git or some client from [here](http://git-scm.com/).
When that's installed, right click in any folder and click on "Git Bash".
When that opens, type in:

```
git clone https://github.com/Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13-RP.git
```

(hint: hold down ctrl and press insert to paste into git bash)
This will take a while to download, but it provides an easier method for updating.

Option 2: Download the source code as a zip by clicking the ZIP button in the
code tab of <https://github.com/Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13-RP>
(note: this will use a lot of bandwidth if you wish to update and is a lot of
hassle if you want to make any changes at all, so it's not recommended.)
