# Icons

This folder contains all(most) of our sound files.

We enforce a rigid-ish structure for organization.

*Please* contact a maintainer before changing the hierarchy!

## Compression

Please use audacity to preprocess sounds obtained from the internet, to save on .rsc size.

## Hierarchy

**Anything not in here is currently undecided and may be freely placed.**
Yes, this currently includes all turfs, mobs, objs, and misc things. Sorry. We'll work on this, we promise. Anyone can propose changes to the hierarchy, just know what you're doing!

- /sound
  - /runtime - follow similar structure inside this, treat it as a sub-copy. sounds in this are copied over for use during runtime
    - **Warning** - everything not in this folder cannot be accessed by "filename" and must be compiled in with 'filename'.
