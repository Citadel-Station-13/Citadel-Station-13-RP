This file contains a list of maps for use in map rotation.
This feature requires you are running a Windows OS (or can other wise run .bat files) and that you are using the tgstation-server toolset in tools/
#Lines starting with # are ignored.
Lines not inside map blocks are also ignored
Duplicated entries use the latter one.
All whitespace at the start and end of lines is ignored. (including indentation, thats just for show)
Format:
#map [map name] (name of .json file in _maps folder without the .json part)
	disabled (disables the map)
endmap

map /datum/map_config/tether
#	disabled
endmap

map /datum/map_conig/triumph
#	disabled
endmap

map /datum/map_config/stellar_delight

endmap
