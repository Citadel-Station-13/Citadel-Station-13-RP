### Breakage

## Uncomment to allow headgibbing
ALLOW_HEADGIBS

## Determines whether bones can be broken through excessive damage to the organ.
BONES_CAN_BREAK


## Determines whether limbs can be amputated through excessive damage to the organ.
LIMBS_CAN_BREAK


### Health

## Uncomment to override default brain health.
#DEFAULT_BRAIN_HEALTH 400

## Level of health at which a mob goes into continual shock. (soft crit)
HEALTH_THRESHOLD_SOFTCRIT 0

## Level of health at which a mob becomes unconscious. (crit)
HEALTH_THRESHOLD_CRIT -50

## Level of health at which a mob becomes dead.
HEALTH_THRESHOLD_DEAD -100


### Organs

## Enable to have organs decay when someone's dead.
ORGAN_DECAY

## Organ decay multiplier.
ORGAN_DECAY_MULTIPLIER 1

## Multiplier which enables organs to take more damage before bones breaking or limbs being destroyed.
## 100 means normal, 50 means half
ORGAN_HEALTH_MULTIPLIER 100

## Multiplier which influences how fast organs regenerate naturally.
## 100 means normal, 50 means half
ORGAN_REGENERATION_MULTIPLIER 75

## Paincrit knocks someone down once they hit 60 shock_stage, so by default make it so that close to 100 additional damage needs to be dealt,
## so that it's similar to HALLOSS. Lowered it a bit since hitting paincrit takes much longer to wear off than a halloss stun.
ORGAN_DAMAGE_SPILLOVER_MULTIPLIER



#### REVIVAL ####
