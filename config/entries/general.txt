# You can use the @ character at the beginning of a config option to lock it from being edited in-game
# Example usage:
# @SERVERNAME CitadelRP
# Which sets the SERVERNAME, and disallows admins from being able to change it using View Variables.
# @LOG_TWITTER 0
# Which explicitly disables LOG_TWITTER, as well as locking it.
# There are various options which are hard-locked for security reasons.

## Uncomment to enable minimap generation
MINIMAPS_ENABLED

## System command that invokes youtube-dl, used by Play Internet Sound.
## You can install youtube-dl with
## "pip install youtube-dl" if you have pip installed
## from https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/releases
## or your package manager
## The default value assumes youtube-dl is in your system PATH
# INVOKE_YOUTUBEDL youtube-dl

## CLIENT VERSION CONTROL
## This allows you to configure the minimum required client version, as well as a warning version, and message for both.
## These trigger for any version below (non-inclusive) the given version, so 510 triggers on 509 or lower.
## These messages will be followed by one stating the clients current version and the required version for clarity.
## If CLIENT_WARN_POPUP is uncommented a popup window with the message will be displayed instead
#CLIENT_WARN_VERSION 511
#CLIENT_WARN_POPUP
#CLIENT_WARN_MESSAGE Byond released 511 as the stable release. You can set the framerate your client runs at, which makes the game feel very different and cool. Shortly after its release we will end up using 511 client features and you will be forced to update.
CLIENT_ERROR_VERSION 511
CLIENT_ERROR_MESSAGE Your version of byond is not supported. Please upgrade.
## The minimum build needed for joining the server, if using 512, a good minimum build would be 1421 as that disables the Middle Mouse Button exploit.
CLIENT_ERROR_BUILD 1421

## Set to 0 to disable admins being able to have snowflake OOC colors
ALLOW_ADMIN_OOCCOLOR

## Uncomment to set the number of /world/Reboot()s before the DreamDaemon restarts itself. 0 means restart every round. Requires tgstation server tools.
#ROUNDS_UNTIL_HARD_RESTART 5

## Comment to disable sending a toast notification on the host server when initializations complete.
## Even if this is enabled, a notification will only be sent if there are no clients connected.

###Master Controller High Pop Mode###

##The Master Controller(MC) is the primary system controlling timed tasks and events in SS13 (lobby timer, game checks, lighting updates, atmos, etc)
##Default base MC tick rate (1 = process every "byond tick" (see: tick_lag/fps config settings), 2 = process every 2 byond ticks, etc)
##	Setting this to 0 will prevent the Master Controller from ticking
BASE_MC_TICK_RATE 1

##High population MC tick rate
##	Byond rounds timer values UP, but the tick rate is modified with heuristics during lag spites so setting this to something like 2
##	will make it run every 2 byond ticks, but will also double the effect of anti-lag heuristics. You can instead set it to something like
##	1.1 to make it run every 2 byond ticks, but only increase the effect of anti-lag heuristics by 10%. or 1.5 for 50%.
##	(As an aside, you could in theory also reduce the effect of anti-lag heuristics in the base tick rate by setting it to something like 0.5)
HIGH_POP_MC_TICK_RATE 1.1

##Engage high pop mode if player count raises above this (Player in this context means any connected user. Lobby, ghost or in-game all count)
HIGH_POP_MC_MODE_AMOUNT 65

##Disengage high pop mode if player count drops below this
DISABLE_HIGH_POP_MC_MODE_AMOUNT 60

## Uncomment to prevent the world from sleeping while no players are connected after initializations
#RESUME_AFTER_INITIALIZATIONS

## Threshold (in deciseconds) for real time between ticks before we start dumping profiles
DRIFT_DUMP_THRESHOLD 40

## How long to wait (in deciseconds) after a profile dump before logging another tickdrift sourced one
