# You can use the @ character at the beginning of a config option to lock it from being edited in-game
# Example usage:
# @SERVERNAME CitadelRP
# Which sets the SERVERNAME, and disallows admins from being able to change it using View Variables.
# @LOG_TWITTER 0
# Which explicitly disables LOG_TWITTER, as well as locking it.
# There are various options which are hard-locked for security reasons.
