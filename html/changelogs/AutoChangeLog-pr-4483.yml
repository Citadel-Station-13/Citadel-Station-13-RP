changes: 
  - rscadd: "new item rendering system, please report bugs"
  - refactor: "items now can support species-default-icons and per-file-icons. A new worn rendering system has been added that is extensible, modular, and will help when we implement emissives."
  - code_imp: "all future item PRs/item containing PRs MUST USE PER FILE when possible, to reduce the bloat in default icons"
  - rscdel: "some useless files that weren't used for years
icon: some inhand files were merged (ironically) because they were too small for default files to justify another category"
  - code_imp: "getFlatIcon has been optimized and rewritten."
