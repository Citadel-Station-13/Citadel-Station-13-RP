changes:
  - bugfix: "loadout items with a changed name/desc should no longer double sanitize"
  - bugfix: "collars don't reset their name when you apply a tag now\n:cl:\n<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your GitHub username as author ingame. -->\n<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags, changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->"
