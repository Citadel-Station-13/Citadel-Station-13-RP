  - rscadd: Introduces the all-new Vampire/Vetalan trait. This is a merger of bloodsucker,
      major darksight, numbing bites, antiseptic saliva, major burn weakness, and
      photosensitivity.
  - bugfix: Patches bloodpacks to not allow literally anyone with hands to apply it
      to their face to gain nutrients. Ex3-378 does not have a mouth and runs on electricity.

      electricity.
