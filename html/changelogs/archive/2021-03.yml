  drofoljaelisglis:
  - bugfix: Fixed the invisible sprite on the toe-less/digitigrade jackboot variants.
  - imageadd: Adjusted the sprite on the knee-length and thigh-length jackboots (normal
      and toe-less/digitigrade versions) to make them more visually distinct from
      the regular jackboot sprites. Now they should align with the location they're
      supposed to reach to.

2021-03-07:
  drofoljaelisglis:
  - rscadd: New clothing items have been added.
  - tweak: Many departmental loadout items that accidentally excluded certain roles
      of the department have been fixed, and in some cases items that were not role-restricted
      were given proper restrictions. The same is true for species-restricted items.
      Some items have had role-restriction removed, as well.
  - tweak: All items that were once named with the prefix "Civilian" have had the
      prefix removed (This isn't a Military RP server, and there is no need to explicitly
      specify it is "Civilian" if any role regardless of department can select it),
      and role-restricted items were given their own category in the loadout. The
      exception to this is species-restricted items, which still have their respective
      department items kept in Xenowear.
  - tweak: Naming consistency has been improved in the loadout.
  - bugfix: Simon Pants and Simon Jacket now have visible object sprites.
  - bugfix: Vox Pressure Suits now all have object sprites separate from the mob sprites.
  - bugfix: Loadout behavior is now less buggy.
  - bugfix: Many cases of repeated declaration in the loadout have been fixed.
  - bugfix: Broken Teshari loadout options have been fixed. The sprites for some of
      these items are still broken, but not all. Fixing all of them is beyond the
      scope of this update, however.
  - bugfix: Miscellaneous clothing sprites have been fixed, from object to mob sprite.
  - imageadd: Gives the Vox Pressure Suits as well as Simon Pants & Simon Jacket object
      sprites.
  - imagedel: Many duplicate sprites were removed.
  - spellcheck: The teshari's "chief engineer cloak" is now named appropriately, and
      is no longer the "cheif engineer cloak".
  - code_imp: 'Much of the code associated with the loadout has been touched, and
      in some cases, rewritten entirely. Role-restricted items have been given their
      own file, and now use an inheritance system that eliminates the need to constantly
      re-declare restrictions for items that have more than one role that can take
      it (ex: Departmental items). Xenowear/Species-Restricted items have been re-written
      from the ground up to follow the same more sensible inheritance structure. The
      latter case is an especially significant improvement, as before there were issues
      with category placement, selectability, and in general was reported to be very
      buggy.'
