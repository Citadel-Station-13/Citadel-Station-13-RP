      accurately, it automates updating your character setup.  None of this code does
      anything you could not already do manually on the Character Setup screen, it
      simply does it automatically for you. ALL of these changes are optional, toggled
      on the VORE tab of character setup.

      you used to leave last time.  Departing thru the elevators will set your spawn
