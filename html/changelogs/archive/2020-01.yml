  - rscadd: Depending on intent, robots are now can be petted or punched (without

      damage to borgs.
  BonniePandora:
  - tweak: '"Say" and "Whisper" now have a cancel button on their pop-up box. "Me"
      and "Subtle" also have this, in addition to being a multiline text box now instead
      of the old single line one.'
  Buffalowing:

  - rscadd: Added the Rapid Piping Device!
  - tweak: Made digital T-valves and air injectors deconstructable.
  - tweak: Changed security's air injectors to require armoury access to deconstruct.
      (Remote control remains as it was.)
  Hatterhat:
  - tweak: Hardsuit pieces (gauntlets, boots, chestpiece, helmet) now have PHORONGUARD.
  - code_imp: PHORONGUARD is supposed to be a flag and not an item_flag. Adjustments
      made. Probably.
  - rscadd: Advanced ore scanners; scan in a 5x5 area, work in 1 second, gives numbers
      of ores in the scanned area.
  - rscadd: Ore scanners and advanced ore scanners are printable from R&D now. Advanced
      scanners can be obtained from the mining vendor, too.

  - rscadd: Medihounds now get a large beaker, instead of a standard beaker.
  - bugfix: Sandstone can now be used for making plant plots.
  - rscadd: Science utility uniforms now exist.

      work very well.
  - rscadd: Some tools dig sand up faster than others.
  - code_imp: Shovels are now pickaxe subtypes.
  - rscadd: Miners now get magboots. They're not required, but you might as well have

      voidsuit or access the objects tab to use it.

  - bugfix: You can set people on fire with a welding tool now.
  - rscadd: Ore scanners can now have their range switched around with an alt-click!
  - tweak: Ore boxes no longer explode and drop all their contents on ex_act(), meaning
      that they probably shouldn't crash servers when they get broken. I hope.
  - tweak: Wearing equipment with negative slowdown values (i.e. alien enhancement
      vests) will no longer be useless if you've taken an equipment-slowdown-affecting
      trait such as Major Hardy.
  - rscadd: SMES coil variants (capacitance/transmission) are now in Cargo at 25 points
      apiece!

  - tweak: Fuzzy legcuffs take 3 seconds to break out of instead of 30. Yikes, bro.
  - code_imp: Disabling the GENERATE_MAP setting in config.txt now prevents submaps
      from generating. This prevents the use of shuttles, but also makes the whole
      map initialize really, really fast.
  - rscadd: Sharpening kits! Hit a whetstone with material sheets to make it, then
      add sheets and apply a suitable weapon.
  Heroman3003:
  - rscadd: Allows voidsuits to have parts attached and removed while held in hand
      (but still not when worn).

      and automatically deposit ore in boxes if one is being pulled.
  deathride58:
  - bugfix: Added a sanity check to the add() proc in zone datums, which should hopefully
      fix the issue where unsimulated turfs get added to ZAS zones and cause runtimes
      that make travis fail
  kevinz000:
  - code_imp: BYOND 513 support added.

      you' types. More yet may come.

  - rscdel: Removed damage from hail altogether as it only served to increase lag
      and spam the victim.

      space con->flight con, protocol observance, etc.
  - rscdel: Removed a pair of old boots.
  - rscadd: You can now fly the excursion shuttle down to the surface and back to
      orbit again.
  - rscadd: adds a slew of new GPS units, new sprites are a mix of Polaris variants
      (med/sec/generic) and kitbashed by me.
  - bugfix: 'fixed a lack of gps units in lockers (now available from; mining, research/rd,
      security/hos, medical/cmo, eng/ce/atm, hop/cd. original sources: explo/sar/PF/xenoarch)'
