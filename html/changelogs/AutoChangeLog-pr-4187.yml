changes: 
  - rscadd: "2 30x30 landing pads to the rift map, these are located west and southwest of the trade pad."
  - rscadd: "\"snowy gravel\" turf for pathing."
  - rscadd: "edges and surround overlays for rift's snow texture and the new gravsnow texture.
tweak: renamed the old \"gravsnow\" to \"gravsnow2\" (Now matches it's accompanying snow texture \"snow2\")"
  - imageadd: "added gravsnow, gravsnow_edges, gravsnow_surround to snow_new.dmi"
  - imageadd: "added snow_edges, snow_surround to snow_new.dmi. (These are based on and connect seamlessly to the snow texture from snow_new.dmi being used in rift, as opposed to the currently existing ones based on snow2)"
  - code_imp: "added possibly jank code for the new turf/overlays."
