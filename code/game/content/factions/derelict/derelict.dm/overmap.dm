[b][i]Note from Temporal:[/i][/b] [i]If I am correct, this orbital installation is what's commonly known as a 'Shield Projector.'
Boarding and activating it would create a path closer to the Blackhole. In theory.
It is unlikely we have any other way to proceed further. Risk taking seems to be your specialty, no?[/i][/center]"}

[b][i]Note from Temporal:[/i][/b] [i]This is troubling. The structure appears to be siphoning something from the Blackhole in the center of this system.
This vessels scanners are unable to parse the structure, likely due to its size. I am however detecting energy signatures from within.
It seems this is the end of the line. For our sake, I hope you are ready.[/i][/center]"}

[b][i]Note from Temporal:[/i][/b] [i]Normally, being this close to such a large Blackhole would have either fried us with untold amounts of radiation, pulled us in past its event horizon or crushed us. Somehow, this is not the case. It is very likely the Blackhole within the systems center has been tampered with and is currently being inhibited. I am unsure what is doing it, but it can't be anything good.[/i][/center]"}
