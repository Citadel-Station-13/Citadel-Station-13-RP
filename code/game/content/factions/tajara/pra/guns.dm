/* Notes on PRA Firearms:
The People's Republic of Adhomai (PRA) is a authoritarian socialist regime reminiscent of the Stalin era Soviet Union.
The creation of the PRA was a result of the rapid social changes on Adhomai brought about by contact with aliens namely humans.
Despite the successes of the counter revolutions they are still the largest and most advanced Tajara nation. Though they are
signifcantly behind human nations when it comes to energy weapons they aren't far behind in terms of ballistics.
They also share idealogical and economic connections to the Interplanetary Worker's League one of the most powerful
members of the Orion Confederation, who have greatly influenced their weaposn development. PRA weapons therefore
are heavily influenced by Soviet futurism and other depictions of future soviet/socialist states.*/
