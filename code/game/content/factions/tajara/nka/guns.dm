// New Kingdom of Adhomai (NKA) Firearms
///////////////////////////////////////////
/* Notes on NKA Firearms:
The New Kingdom of Adhomai (NKA) is both a backward reactionary monarchy and a space faring nation. Their technology \
is a strange mix of both laughably dated and suprisingly advanced. The political situation in the NKA was until recent \
unfavorable to technological development, as such the NKA has a bevy of extremely dated weapons that are noticably \
behind their counterparts on Adhomai. A newly empowered faction within the Royal Court led by the crown prince \
believes that the NKA can modernize into a technofuedal state and are vigorously pursuing modernization with a \
traditional twist. As a result the advanced tech of the NKA serve to reinforce traditional values and feudalism. \
Their weapon design reflects this as even advanced weapons have traditional elements. Ideally advanced weapons of \
the NKA use some handcrafted parts at the very least. Many also have aesthetics reminescent of a fuedal ideal \
as their noble knights can't be knightly unless their weapons are ornate enough. */
