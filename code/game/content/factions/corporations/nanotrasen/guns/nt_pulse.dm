		A breakthrough weapon from Nanotrasen's Research Division, pulse weapons utilize rare crystals in its generation array,
		allowing for a more laminar and cohesive beam than prior thought possible. Closely guarded designs to this day,
		pulse weapons are some of the only energy-based armaments able to consistently outperform any kinetic alternative.
