/**
 * Weapons for NT's Internal Security.
 *
 * * Above-average energy weapons
 * * Expensive
 * * Joint with Hephaestus / Vey-Med, canonically
 * * There's probably a neat amount of these just floating around the Frontier now from losses.
 *
 * Things to keep in mind:
 *
 * * Stun does not mean something is cheap as, or cheaper than, lethal.
 * * Stun in this codebase is not treated as any special or even preferable damage type.
 * * Nanotrasen uses stun weaponry for arrests, but in-canon security is rarely having to
 *   use physical and ranged force against other employees.
 * * Stun weapons should generally be worse at stunning than lethal modes of that weapon
 *   are at downing someone who is armored.
