		A monstrously powerful rifle made during the peak of the Phoron War, the Hephaestus Industries
		"SRP" anti-material rifle was made to counter the development of personal exosuits as well as the
		looming proliferation of heavy combat synthetics. As potent as it is unwieldly, the recoil generated
		by this rifle is enough to fracture bone and dent a domestic synthetic's chassis - restricting its
		use to the few combat androids sturdy enough to use it in sustained fire. The line was discontinued
		by treaty after the War, with few surviving prototypes able to be found here and there around the Frontier.
