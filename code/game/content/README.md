# Game System - Content

Content specific to Citadel RP's in-game universe go in here.

This includes things like:
- Faction definitions
- Factional content (guns, mechs, etc)

Basically, if the answer to 'is this only required within Citadel RP's in game lore' is *yes*, it goes in here.

As an example: Even Nanotrasen itself is not required for the **game** to work - it is just the most important, and the default player faction of the Citadel RP server.

## Notes

- Factions don't necessarily need to be a single faction. E.g. 'pirates' is a generic faction, but they certainly aren't just all a big allied corporation.
