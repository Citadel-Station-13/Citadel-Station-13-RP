# Game System - Content

Content specific to Citadel RP's in-game universe go in here.

This includes things like:
- Faction definitions
- Factional content (guns, mechs, etc)
- One off gimmick content that doesn't belong to a module

Basically, if the answer to 'is this only required within Citadel RP's in game lore and world' is *yes*, it goes in here.

If something is generally useful for the core of this *science-fantasy game codebase*, it should probably be a proper module.

As an example: Even Nanotrasen itself is not required for the **game** to work - it is just the most important, and the default player faction of the Citadel RP server.

## Notes

- Factions don't necessarily need to be a single faction. E.g. 'pirates' is a generic faction, but they certainly aren't just all a big allied corporation.
- Things in here can be as small as an item, to a whole world system like the Clockwork Cult.
- If something is in a faction it **does not mean** it's faction-exclusive. It just specifies that it either
