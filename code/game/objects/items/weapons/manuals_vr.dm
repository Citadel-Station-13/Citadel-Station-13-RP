					<li>He says, "What we're really worried about is creating some sort of creature that would be functioning like a human being, yet have strong animal-like features.*</li>
					<li>*Grotesque mutations have been reported.</li>
					<li>Certainly, if the mouse stood on its hind legs, if it stood on its hind legs and said, 'Hi, I'm Mickey!' we'd be worried. We'd be more than worried," the doctor said.</li>
					<li>We are moving rapidly into a post-Darwinian era, an era when species will no longer exist.</li>
					<li>Once the general public gets the hang of genetic engineering, there will be an explosion of monstrous creations.</li>
					<li>Designing creatures will be a new art form as creative as painting or sculpture.</li>
					<li>Few of the new creations will be masterpieces, but all will bring joy to their creators and diversity to our fauna and flora.</li>
					<li>...</li>
					<li>A 60 million-year-old mouse that had a rare and poisonous bite? The humanized mice?</li>
					<li>They will have to explain themselves.</li>
					<li>...</li>
					<li>What if the human mind somehow got trapped inside of a sheep's head?</li>
					<li>What if...What if...What if...</li>
					<li>...</li>
					<li>Although constitutional prohibitions against slavery prevent the patenting of people, some of my best friends are clones.</li>
					<li>Topping seasonal wishlists, uncertainties about the health and lifespan of clones persist.</li>
					<li>...</li>
					<li>On the underside of the aging spaceship, genetic replicas of existing dogs thrive alongside tiny bodies hidden in flowerpots in a sand-filled fishtank.</li>
