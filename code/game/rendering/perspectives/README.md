# Perspectives

The Perspectives system is used to encapsulate graphics, visuals, and rendering 'experienced' by an entity.

This way, shifting people's view around is easier and more standardized.

As an example, something like a helmet camera has its own perspective because the perspective of the mob wearing it is what the mob's player sees, and not what someone merely connected to a helmet would see.

Meanwhile, an observer viewing a mob's perspective can see the world through their eyes, literally.
