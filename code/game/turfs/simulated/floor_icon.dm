 * welcome to the less modular but more sensical and efficient way to do icon edges
 * instead of having every turf check, we only have turfs tha can spill onto others check, and apply their edges to other turfs
 * now only on /turf/simulated/floor, because let's be honest,
 * 1. no one used borders on walls
 * 2. if you want a floor to spill onto a wall, go ahead and reconsider your life/design choices
 * 3. i can think of a reason but honestly performance is better than some niche case of floor resin creeping onto walls or something, use objs for that.
