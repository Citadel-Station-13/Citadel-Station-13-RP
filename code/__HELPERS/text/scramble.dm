The difference with stutter is that this proc can stutter more than 1 letter
The issue here is that anything that does not have a space is treated as one word (in many instances). For instance, "LOOKING," is a word, including the comma.
It's fairly easy to fix if dealing with single letters but not so much with compounds of letters./N
