 * Checks if an attacking atom is within the defensive arc of a defending atom.
 *
 * * This does not support pixel movement.
 * * A null source is always inside defensive arc.
 *
 * todo: verify behavior.
 *
 * Attacking entity can be:
 *
 * * /obj/projectile - treated as projectile
 * * /datum/thrownthing - treated as thrown
 * * anything else - treated as an /atom-ish source.
 *
 * @params
 * * defending - the defending atom
 * * attacking - the attacking entity
 * * arc - the arc to check
 * * round_up_arc - if the attacking atom is not a projectile or something with angle sim, should we round their defensive angle up or down?
 * * use_dir - use this dir, not the defending atom's dir
 *
 * @return TRUE if they're within arc, FALSE otherwise
