 * Sprites generously 'borrowed' from /tg/station.
 * Idea is from /tg/station, but entirely reimplemented here.

 * todo: add in a way to preload a template so it starts out sculpted, and an initialize() override for such
 * todo: de/serialization
 * todo: sculpting with shit tools should result in a bad image
