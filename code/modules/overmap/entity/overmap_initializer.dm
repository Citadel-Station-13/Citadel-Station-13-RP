	 * You might have noticed that no entity typepath variable is included.

	 *
	 * The initializer system is meant to encapsulate all possible modifiers and
	 * entity data to inject into an entity. You are not to make subtypes of
	 * entity to do that as that would defeat the purpose of going out of our way
	 * to make initializers.
	 *
	 * This way, we can have data-driven overmap entities and avoid any weird
	 * hardcoded behavior. If you really need hardcoded behavior, make a
	 * component for your map and inject that into the entity with the initializer system.
	 *
	 * If you need to do something with the initializer and cannot, the issue is that
	 * the initializer system needs to be upgraded, not that you should be subtyping
	 * entity.
