/**
 * reserved turfs as part of reserved zlevels
 *
 * reserved zlevels are sealed, no-teleport, no-wireless, no-telecomms levels used for internal purposes.
 *
 * players should not spend too much time in reserved areas, as many things will flat out not work in them for optimization reasons.
 *
 * maybe someday we'll have a non-3d-prism game engine and we can have something actually reasonable instead of this pile of shit.
