# Characters

A big semi-subsystem-module of the game.

Contains things like shapeshifts, descriptors, records, etc.

All in all, a grab-bag of things used to manipulate characters. In the game. Surprise, surprise.

Things in here may be used as a library elsewhere, and vice versa.

Examples;

- bodysets is used in here as appearance descriptors
- shapeshifts can be used in here / elsewhere as appearance descriptors
- records are used by other game systems
