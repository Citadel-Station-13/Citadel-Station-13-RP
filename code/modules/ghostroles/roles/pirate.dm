Only a fool would anger Nebula Gas by raiding their station, although NebGas vessels in transit are fair game. Attempting to visit NanoTrasen's primary facility is equally dangerous and ill-advised. Focusing on isolated vessels in flight or expeditions on planets may be the most reliable way to score precious booty.
