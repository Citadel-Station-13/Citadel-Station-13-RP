	Thankfully there is a Nanotrasen base nearby the ground around which are said to be rich in resources. Through the Baronness agreement with Nanotrasen you may \
	harvest these resources and trade with the crew. Hopefully that makes the long walk here from Na'sahira worth it. Maybe this crew can even afford to pay in things \

	theft or vandalism are permitted especially in the name of survival. Serious criminal acts however may see your character punished by the Na'sahira Constabulary whose \
	form of justice is harsher then Nanotrasen's. Na'sahira colonists are permadeath characters, be very careful."
