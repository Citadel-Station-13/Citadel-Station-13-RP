	through the Phoron Wars, albeit to a greatly limited degree. Issues with \
	properly shackling prisoners installed in the frames lead to many accidents. \
	Eventually opting to use drone chips as the technology became available, Syndicate \
	cyborgs were often ruthless hunter/killers and were rightfully feared. Since \
	the end of the war, most surviving units have been decomissioned. However, it \
	is not unheard of for parties to discover active models in the field. Such \
	encounters often end poorly."
