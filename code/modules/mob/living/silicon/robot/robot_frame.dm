 * A frame is a chassis-iconset tuple.
 *
 * * This is the thing you can actually choose as a player.
 * * This is a thing because icon and chassis are generally disjoint; you don't
 *   want to constrain sprite design to a single functionality, necessarily.
 *   Thus, another layer of abstraction was added.
