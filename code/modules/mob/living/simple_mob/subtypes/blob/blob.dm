	Every Blob starts out as a Seed, which either hosts inside of an unwitting victim, \
	or simply hurtles through space until it collides with an obstacle. Upon impact or \
	'hatching', depending on species, a Blob's seed casing splits open to reveal its gelatinous \
	core. Powerful and dense, Blobs replicate rapidly in most environments, spreading to envelop \
	inorganic and organic matter alike. Blobs are able to produce harvesting factories which pull \
	nutrients out of the air and local enveloped items. They are also able to generate ambulatory \
	spores which can come to aid the Blob Core in its defense. A Blob which successfully reaches \
	critical mass will produce more seeds, and jettison them off blindly into space. Thus the \
	cycle repeats itself."
