	the Marauder has fully supplanted its predecessor. Deployed by Nanotrasen to the fiercest conflict zones during the Phoron War, \
	Marauders quickly gained a reputation for brutal efficiency. Marauders are fielded by the megacorporation to hot zones across \
	the Frontier to this day. Thanks to its status as a military grade weapons platform and its highly proprietary equipment, \
	the Marauder is generally unavailable to civilians - including low-level Nanotrasen duty stations and allied corporations. \
	Standing at 12'(3m) tall, the Marauder cockpit is complex and spacious enough to grant the pilot a full range of movement \
	within its spherical shell."

	next-generation communications and electronic warfare suites. Due to the tactical nature of the Seraph's battlefield role, \
