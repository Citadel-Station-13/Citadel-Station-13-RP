//Gutshanks parasitize until they reach maturity and molt. They continue to feed primarily on blood, but at this stage they begin to process silt and rocks in their diet as well.
//Shanks mature even further into something like Silt Striders, which can be used as pack animals and safe transit over lava floes.
