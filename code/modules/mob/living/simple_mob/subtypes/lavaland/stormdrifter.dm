	were so named due to their tendency to get caught up in ash storms, which might carry them for hundreds to thousands of \
	miles before dropping them nearby. The arrival of a pod of Stormdrifters is often considered an omen of especially bad \
	weather. Rarely, these creatures may drift down closer to Surt's surface, where Ashlanders will eagerly capture them for \
