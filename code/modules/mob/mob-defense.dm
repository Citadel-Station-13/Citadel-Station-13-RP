/**
 * An override of /atom/proc/run_armorcalls(), with zone filter capability.
 *
 * This is what you should override, instead of the check/run procs.
 *
 * * At current moment, due to expensiveness reasons, not providing filter_zone will result in only SHIELDCALL_ARG_DAMAGE being modified.
 *
 * @params
 * * shieldcall_args - passed in shieldcall args list to modify
 * * fake_attack - are we just checking armor?
 * * filter_zone - confine to a certain hit zone. this is **required** for full processing, otherwise we just check overall damage.
