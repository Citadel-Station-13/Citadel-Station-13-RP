# Characteristics

A system to do character stats.

This page is heavily WIP.

## Config

CHARACTERISTICS_ENABLED - defaults to true; without this, preferences won't show these things at all.
CHARACTERISTICS_ACTIVE - defaults to false; nothing happens without this, everyone gets baseline average.

## Specializations

Special modifiers that increase adaptation towards one archetype
Should be very broad and encourage character development towards a specific field

Heavily WIP

## Skills

Bay-like enum'd numeric stats with levels from 0 to 6 (basic to professional)

### Recommended Use Cases

WIP

## Stats

Heavily numeric stats that are really low level.
It's not recommended to use these for "abstract" concepts to prevent minmaxing.
It's not recommended to overuse these at all to prevent minmaxing.

### Recommended Use Cases

WIP

## Talents

Boolean abilities that potentially have special code handling.
Allows for tracking mobs, almost like a /datum/element.
Think Barotrauma talents.
