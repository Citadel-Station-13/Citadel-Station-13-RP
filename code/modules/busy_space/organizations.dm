They control a sizable fleet of vessels of various sizes which are given autonomy from the central command to engage in trading. They also host a fleet of combat vessels which respond directly to the central command for defending traders when necessary. They are in control of many large scale trade stations across the known galaxy, even in non-human space. Generally, they are multi-purpose stations but they always keep areas filled with duty-free shops. Almost anything is sold there and products that are forbidden or have insanely high taxes in other places are generally sold in the duty-free shops at very cheap and low prices.<br><br>They are the creators of the Tradeband language, created specially for being a lingua franca where every merchant can understand each other independent of language or nationality."

At this time the \"Free Merchants\" were in decay because of the high taxes and tariffs that were generally applied on the products that they tried to import or export. Another issue was that big trans-stellar corporations were constantly blocking their products to prospective buyers in order to form their monopolies. Issac decided to organize the \"Free Merchants\" into a legitimate organization to lobby and protest against the unfair practices of the major corporations and the governments that were in their pocket. At the same time, they wanted to organize and sell their things at better prices. The organization started relatively small but by 2450 it became one of the biggest conglomerates with a significant amount of the merchants of the galaxy being a part of the FTU. At the same time, the Free Trade Union started to popularize tradeband in the galaxy as the language of business. Around 2500, the majority of independent merchants were part of the FTU with significant influence on the galactic scale.
