	desc = "The NT/HI-S-1 'Secutor' standard service sidearm was designed by Nanotrasen in conjunction with Hephaestus Industries. Following years of cooperative development, this weapon features Nanotrasen's superior neuro-disruptive electronic payload in a new frame heavily influenced by Hephaestus' more popular and ergonomic taser. Designed exclusively for Nanotrasen Security personnel, this weapon features three fire modes: a non-lethal stun bolt, a low power phaser medium, and an alert-locked lethal contingency. This state-of-the-art weapon serves as a symbolic representation of Nanotrasen and Hephaestus' lasting cooperative relationship - and it's an excellent sidearm to boot."
