/**
 * power networks
 *
 * how this works:
 *
 * powernets are generic and make some assumptions:
 * - We **cannot** trust that machines have a particular processing order (e.g. suppliers before/after consumers)
 * - We **can** trust that we tick in sync with machinery. We **can** trust that off-tick machinery will compensate their usage/demands as needed.
 *
 * we make these assumptions because
 * - specific sorting / bracketing for machinery may not be available, and even if it is, it's usually too stiff to demand of implementations.
 * - we cannot actually compensate for machinery that tick "wrongly", without overcomplicating this by having power draw have an overengineered
 *       implementation that involves tracking the time period over which power is used and all sorts of nasty things that we really don't want
 *       to have to care about. all we can do is expect that people put in the correct values.
 *
 * all variables are in **kilowatts** unless otherwise stated.
