	desc = "The oldest and most widespread religious sect on Ahdomai, the teachings of Tajr-kii S'randarr pervade almost every aspect of modern Tajaran culture, from sun motifs in paintings to turns of phrase referring to “the Light”. The Tajr-kii hold that S'randarr and Messa are locked in eternal battle over the fate of the dead. When someone dies, the soul travels to Messa's realm, known as The Bounty. The hope is that S'randarr's ever-watchful Eye can locate the soul before it is drained by Messa, and can be lifted from the Bounty to be safely stored within S'randarr Himself."

	desc = "The fringe and relatively disliked religious sect on Ahdomai, the teachings of Tajr-kii Messa, whose followers are known as the Shards of Messa. There are two main principles of Tajr-kii Messa, everything is a cycle of death that should not be broken, and embrace change in any form it may come in. The end goal of life is to bring as much to Messa as one can when they die. Another core behavior principle is to act in the moment and on impulse. Death is more freely accepted to be able to become one with Messa, and assist her in her fight with S'randarr. Anything that can lead to more of that, such as a larger population to be offering souls with, is focused, and will be desired by those who follow Messa. They will wish to grow in knowledge and enrich their soul with that knowledge, so that Messa may have that much more power over S'randarr. It is widely believed that the Shards of Messa, and Messa herself were the ones who caused The Frost, and for such are hunted and killed, so many Shards now conceal their true beliefs in order to survive."
