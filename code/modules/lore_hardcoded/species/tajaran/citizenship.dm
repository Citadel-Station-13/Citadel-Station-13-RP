The PRA is struggling to hold true to its radical ideals while an entrenched upper party stubbornly tries to hold onto power, and the Confederate Commonwealth’s demands de-escalation on its borders.

The lofty titles of the nobles disguise that most of the nobility's financial situation remains only marginally better than the peasants. The NKA finds itself struggling to function with its limited constitutional powers, factional in-fighting between the military and the civilian government, and technological stagnation.

A majority of them have created tiny Tajaran communities, where one can sample authentic Tajaran cuisine, goods, religion, and medicine from the homeworld. A majority of the Tajara are refugees who depend deeply on their culture, as it’s all they have left due to discrimination. Some Tajaran emigrants are pirates, smugglers, or part of organized crime families, profiting off the decentralized powers of the galaxy. The newest waves of Tajaran emigrates are young, bold, and adventurous settlers usually who clash with the older immigrants who worked hard for their life offworld. Tajara under this banner are for individualism, freedom, and self-reliance."
