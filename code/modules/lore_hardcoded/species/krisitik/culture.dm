	the crowded cities. Clanners tend to be communal sharing their resources to survive. Clan settlements or districts are often all employed in a single trade which they export in order \
	to support their life. This trade can be anything from farming (hydroponics on Murith and more recently overground farming on some colonies), to mining to even complex professions, \
	such as operating powerplants or spaceship docks. Clanners are run by a council of its most elder and respected women who tend to pass their positions to their daughters upon retirement \

	of their lives contending with the same problem as human spacers these Krisitik have become adept at existing in enviroments where atmospheric pressure and gravity are not guaranteed. \
	Most of this group has been united by the Murith League of Teamsters whose network of independ starship operators keeps the isolated asteroid bases supplied and the supply ships busy with \
