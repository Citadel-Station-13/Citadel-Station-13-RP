	Today it is a planet of endless underground tunnels ranging from underground metropolises to countless caves overgrown by genetically engineered fungus. Home to the vast majority \
	of the Krisitik species it faces mass emigration, encouraged by the United Bureaus, as its citizens seek to escape the poverty, crowding and crime endemic to its cities."

	self suffcient vessels equipped to last decades searching for worlds to set up new hidden colonies in. When imported FTL drives made these older vessels obsolete instead of scrapping \
	them they were refitted into spaceborne colonies of their own. Over the years the vessels have recieved countless upgrade and added on countless modules from many different species \
	meaning no two are alike. Krisitik from these vessels also have more experience with aliens then the rest of their skin owing the mission of their home ships."

	labryinthine underground settlements and colonies similar to their homeworld. Still aways from that homeworld's sheer crowding and crime mean colonists are much happier and wealthier then their \
	homeworld kin."
