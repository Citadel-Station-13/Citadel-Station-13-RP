	thanks to the tireless efforts of the Alraune and their followers. No polluting industy is allowed on the surface however signifcant industry exists in orbit to support the \
	Alraune's quest to build a galaxy spanning garden. Countless fantastical plants are native to Loam including Ambrosia, Ironwood Trees, and Mono-leaf. The unique flora \
	allows for all the comforts and conviences of living an post industrial society while living in a endlessly bountiful natural paradise. Loam is frequented by tourists of other \
	species, some of which have become permanent residents. These permanent tourists along with in the presence of various diplomatic missions on the planet make Loam the most \
	diverse Alraune garden world."

	desc = "The desert planet dubbed by the Alraune Carnegiea, was the first colony of the Alraune. Originally troubled due to its lack of water, the Alraune quickly adapted both \
	their own bodies and the plants they brought to both be highly water effecient and to draw sustainably from the ground water far beneath the planet's surface. Now Carnegiea, \
	originally resembling a sandy marble from orbit, is pocketed with spots of green as the countless lush desert gardens of the Alraune bring life to the once barren desert. \
	The sarcity of water on the planet has made the Alraune of Carnegeia quite conservative in nature prefering not overexert themselves to mentally or phsycially 'waste good water'."

	even the rocky sides of mountains are covered in the blooms of countless colorful flowers. The vallies beneath the mountains are so isolated by the mountain they are almost \
	natural biodomes and the Alraune that inhabit each make sure to keep each valley in perfect balance. Not all life on Chamerion is welcome by the Alraune though, native to the \
	caves of the planet is the 'Chamerion Blight', the Ouranos (or Uranus) Mushroom. Ouranos spores on Alraune as a parasitic infection driving the Alraune slowly mad and compelling \
	it to spread the parasite to other plants and Alraune. Only treatable in early stages of infection, Ouranos infestations are destroyed with extreme malice wherever they are found \
	even it means killing infected Alraune. The result is that Chamerion Alraune are a cautious and vigilant people unafraid of 'purging parasites' when necessary."

	desc = "A cold planet, Pyrola's prospects as a colony for the Alraune seemed dim during intial colonization efforts. However, the planet's axial tilt meant the short summers \
	of the planet had many hours of sunlight. Alraune quickly adapted trees and planets that took advantage of the long summer days while constructing greenhouses for the winter \
	months. Now no matter the time of year there is somewhere on Pyrola where the surface where there is life and where there isn't. the greenhouses ensure there is something \
	still growing. The Alraune of Pyrola are known to be able to stay awake for days on end and to be able to hibernate for just as long afterword."
