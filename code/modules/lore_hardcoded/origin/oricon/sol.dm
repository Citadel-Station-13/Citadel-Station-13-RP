/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/venusian
	name = "Venus"
	id = "venus"
	desc = "Unlike almost anyone else who would call a planet their home, you've never been to your own planet's surface. Instead, you are from one of the myriad orbital complexes floating in venusian space, used to seeing it's white cloudtops shimmer in the distance amid the pitch blackness of space."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/terran
	name = "Terra"
	id = "terra"
	desc = "You are from Humanity's storied homeworld of Terra. Whether you are from the arcologies spanning much of the planet's verdant surface, or it's many orbital habitats, you are likely to have been taught much about humanity's long history upon Earth."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/lunarian
	name = "Luna"
	id = "luna"
	desc = "You hail directly from Sol's capital body, the terran moon of Luna. It's intricately built and unimaginably busy underground metropolises are the beating heart of modern human culture, and one you know very well at that."


/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/martian
	name = "Mars"
	id = "mars"
	desc = "Blue sunsets upon red sands would be a familiar sight for a Martian such as yourself. You have likely met many Tyrmalin (and possibly are one yourself!) somewhere in the industrial powerhouse that is Mars."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/phobian
	name = "Phobos"
	id = "phobos"
	desc = "Not quite from the red planet itself, you nonetheless know it well, if from a distance. Though a very tiny settlement by every metric, your time in Sol's largest shipyard has likely made you well-acquainted with the intricacies of spacefaring vessels."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/cererian
	name = "Ceres"
	id = "ceres"
	desc = "Though you've no doubt been around Sol's Main Belt at least a couple times, everyone always lands back at Ceres eventually, or so they say. You have seen both the no-nonsense work of asteroid mining operations and the luxurious halls of the big casinos back home in Ceres."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/jovian
	name = "Jupiter"
	id = "jupiter"
	desc = "From either one of Jupiter's countless minor moons and trojan asteroids, or from a space station somewhere in orbit of the gas giant itself, you are quite used to commonplace space travel between the moons and habitats of the bustling Jovian subsystem."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/europan
	name = "Europa"
	id = "europa"
	desc = "Buried safely under the ice, you have once called the jovian moon of Europa your home. Though most only rarely visit it's irradiated surface, anyone there has seen the spacious arcologies which tunnel beneath it, winding all the way down to the moon's frighteningly deep inner ocean."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/ganymedean
	name = "Ganymede"
	id = "ganymede"
	desc = "The largest moon of the Sol System, Ganymede was once your home. The sight of glowing auroras likely remind you of your time there... and of all the radiation there would've been outside, beneath them."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/callistoan
	name = "Callisto"
	id = "callisto"
	desc = "You are from the very cornerstone of the Jovian system itself, the land of it's first settlement, Callisto. You are used to seeing the other moons circle around Jupiter from a safe distance under the windows of biodomes dotting the large ring-shaped cities of Valhalla and Asgard."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/saturnian
	name = "Saturn"
	id = "saturn"
	desc = "Whether from a minor moon's settlement or a habitat in orbit of the Sol System's crown jewel, you come from saturnian space. Somehow, the view of it's rings really doesn't ever get old."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/titanean
	name = "Titan"
	id = "titan"
	desc = "Moon or not, Titan hardly feels like one on the rainy surface. Whether a synthetic or brave organic once living among it's seas of cryogenically cold methane, you come from the highly-flammable world of Titan."

	name = "Enceladus"
	id = "enceladus"
	desc = "White as pristine snow, the world of Enceladus is where you're from. You're well-acquainted with the underwater environment of it's subsurface ocean and have likely seen the fractures along the surface blanketing the dark sky in plumes of snow with your own eyes."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/uranian
	name = "Uranus"
	id = "uranus"
	desc = "The exception of Sol's gas giants in many ways, you are from one of the many large space stations orbiting Uranus. Most people you have known from home worked for one of the gas harvesting and refining companies in some way. Perhaps Phoron is not so different after all?"

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/titanian
	name = "Titania"
	id = "titania"
	desc = "A quiet corner of Sol by most standards, Titania is your home. However, you are no stranger to having to travel away from it, as one would not have found a settlement larger than a small hydroponics-farming town back in Titania."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/neptunian
	name = "Neptune"
	id = "neptune"
	desc = "You come from one of the many space habitats orbiting low over the azure skies of Neptune. The furthest planet from Sol, you know the star best as a dim dot, casting it's cold light towards you from far in the distance."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/tritonian
	name = "Triton"
	id = "triton"
	desc = "Orbiting retrograde around Neptune, the frigid world of Triton was once your home. As it is too, home of scientists and businessmen, more often than not related to the trident planet's fuel export industry."

	name = "Pluto-Charon"
	id = "plutocharon"
	desc = "Two parts of the same whole, as every pluto-charonian knows, the twin ice-worlds of the Kuiper Belt were once your home. Whichever half you happened to live on, you have seen the tether which looms above, linking both dwarf-planets together as glowing city lights sprawl away from it's connection points into each."

/datum/lore/character_background/origin/oricon/sol/eridian
	name = "Eris"
	id = "eris"
	desc = "You are from one of the outermost colonies of the Sol System, the dwarf-planet Eris. Every city you have known there was compact, and buried under kilometers of frozen nitrogen and water ice, with immense freight elevators as the primary way out to the spaceports on it's desolate surface."
