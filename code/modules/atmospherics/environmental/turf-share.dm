 * Used to share a certain temperature & heat capacity's thermal energy with us.
 *
 * * This proc returns the temperature change to apply to the sharer. This means if we heat up,
 *   we will return a negative amount because the sharer is cooling!
 * * If it returns 10, 10 degrees K was imparted onto the sharer during the share.
 * * You can get thermal energy given / taken by multiplying the return with the heat capacity you passed in.
 * * Be very, very, very careful with this proc, as this will immediately slam
 *   into the zone for simulated turfs with no regards for area or any sanity limits.
 * * At '1' share_ratio, the sharer will be brought to the same resultant temperature as us if
 *   all of the thermal energy change is imparted back to it.
 * * limit_ratio is provided so you can limit the amount of energy transferred to a single segment
 *   of say, a heat exchanging pipeline, as while the entire pipeline has a lot of heat capacity,
 *   an individual pipe segment does not.
 * * someone please help do the algebra and see equalize_ratio and limit_ratio aren't just able to be collapsed into one term
 *
 * @params
 * * temperature - the temperature of the sharer
 * * heat_capacity - the specific heat of the sharer in J / K
 * * limit_ratio - a multiplier for the part of 'heat_capacity' that can be drawn from / added to this tick.
 *                 The allowable values are: [0, 1].
 * * equalize_ratio - a limit to delta-energy; 0.5 means only transfer up to 50% of the energy needed to equalize.
 *                 Be very, very careful when setting high values of this!
 *                 The allowable values are: [0, 1].
 * * cell_limit - the maximum effective volume in cells of the share. If we're in a zone with
 *                10 tiles and share_volume is only 2, we will at most equalize the energy
 *                in 1/5 of our zone. This is to artificially limit the effectiveness
 *                of exchanger pipes so they're not exchanging with the entire room.
 *
 * @return the temperature change to the sharer
