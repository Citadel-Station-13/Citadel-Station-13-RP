	depictions sometimes recovered on archaeological digs. Insular and xenophobic, the Scori are more commonly \
	known as Ashlanders. Until recently, the Scori were believed to have gone extinct some tens of thousands of years ago \
	when Surt underwent an as yet unknown cataclysm. Instead, the modern Scori seem to have descended from the cataclysm's \
	survivors. Dwelling deep underground in caves, or travelling across the planet's surface in nomadic caravans, sightings \
	of Scori tribesmen were historically treated as hoaxes. NanoTrasen pathfinding teams operating in the wake of the expedition \
	to Kristen's Harmony have since confirmed the presence of a nearby Scori tribe."
