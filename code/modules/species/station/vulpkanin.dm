	blurb = "Vulpkanin are a species of sharp-witted canine-pideds residing on the planet Altam just barely within the \
	dual-star Vazzend system. Their politically de-centralized society and independent natures have led them to become a species and \
	culture both feared and respected for their scientific breakthroughs. Discovery, loyalty, and utilitarianism dominates their lifestyles \
	to the degree it can cause conflict with more rigorous and strict authorities. They speak a guttural language known as 'Canilunzt' \
	which has a heavy emphasis on utilizing tail positioning and ear twitches to communicate intent."
