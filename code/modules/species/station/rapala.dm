	An Avian species, coming from a distant planet, the Rapalas are the very proud race.  Sol researchers have commented
	on them having a very close resemblance to the mythical race called 'Harpies', who are known for having massive winged
	arms and talons as feet.  They've been clocked at speeds of over 35 miler per hour chasing the planet's many fish-like
	fauna.

	The Rapalan's home-world 'Verita' is a strangely habitable gas giant, while no physical earth exists, there are
	fertile floating islands orbiting around the planet from past asteroid activity.
