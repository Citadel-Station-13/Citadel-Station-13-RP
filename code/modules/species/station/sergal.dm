	blurb = "There are two subspecies of Sergal; Southern and Northern. Northern sergals are a highly aggressive race \
	that lives in the plains and tundra of their homeworld. They are characterized by long, fluffy fur bodies with cold colors; \
	usually with white abdomens, somewhat short ears, and thick faces. Southern sergals are much more docile and live in the \
	Gold Ring City and are scattered around the outskirts in rural areas and small towns. They usually have short, brown or yellow \
	(or other 'earthy' colors) fur, long ears, and a long, thin face. They are smaller than their Northern relatives. Both have strong \
	racial tensions which has resulted in more than a number of wars and outright attempts at genocide. Sergals have an incredibly long \
	lifespan, but due to their lust for violence, only a handful have ever survived beyond the age of 80, such as the infamous and \
	legendary General Rain Silves who is claimed to have lived to 5000."
