	Apidaens are an insectoid race from the far galactic rim.  Although they have only recently been formally
	acknowledged on the Galactic stage, Apidaens are an aged and advanced spacefaring civilization.  Although their exact
	phyisololgy changes based on caste or other unknown selective qualities, Apidaens generally possess compound eyes, between
	four to six limbs, and wings.  Apidaens are able to produce a substance molecularly identical to honey in what is considered
	to be a dramatic example of parallel evolution - or perhaps genetic tampering.  Apidaens inhabit multiple planets in
	a chain of connected star systems, preferring to live in hive-like structures - both subterranean and above ground.

	Apidaens possess some form of hive intelligence, although they still exhibit individual identities and habits.  This
	remnant hive connection is believed to be vestigial, but aids Apidaen navigators in charting courses for their biomechanical
	Hive ships.
