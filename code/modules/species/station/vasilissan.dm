	Vasilissans are a tall, lanky, spider like people.  Each having four eyes, an extra four, large legs sprouting from their back,
	and a chitinous plating on their body, and the ability to spit webs from their mandible lined mouths.  They are a recent discovery
	by Nanotrasen, only being discovered roughly seven years ago.  Before they were found they built great cities out of their silk,
	being united and subjugated in warring factions under great <b>Star Queens</b>, who forced the working class to build huge,
	towering cities to attempt to reach the stars, which they worship as gems of great spiritual and magical significance.
