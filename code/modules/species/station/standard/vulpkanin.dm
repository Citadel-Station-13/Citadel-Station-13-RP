	Vulpkanin are a species of sharp-witted canine-pideds residing on the planet Altam just barely within the
	dual-star Vazzend system. Their politically de-centralized society and independent natures have led them to become a species and
	culture both feared and respected for their scientific breakthroughs. Discovery, loyalty, and utilitarianism dominates their lifestyles
	to the degree it can cause conflict with more rigorous and strict authorities. They speak a guttural language known as 'Canilunzt'
	which has a heavy emphasis on utilizing tail positioning and ear twitches to communicate intent.
