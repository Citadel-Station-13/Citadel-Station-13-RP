		Humans are a space-faring species hailing originally from the planet Earth in the Sol system.
		They are currently among the most numerous known species in the galaxy, in both population and holdings,
		and are relatively technologically advanced. With good healthcare and a reasonable lifestyle,
		they can live to around 110 years. The oldest humans are around 150 years old.

		Humanity is the primary driving force for rapid space expansion, owing to their strong, expansionist central
		government and opportunistic Trans-Stellar Corporations. The prejudices of the 21st century have mostly
		given way to bitter divides on the most important issue of the timesï¿½ technological expansionism,
		with the major human factions squabbling over their approach to technology in the face of a
		looming singularity.

		While most humans have accepted the existence of aliens in their communities and workplaces as a
		fact of life, exceptions abound. While more culturally diverse than most species, humans are
		generally regarded as somewhat technophobic and isolationist by members of other species.
