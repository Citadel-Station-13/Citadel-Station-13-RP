	An amphibious species, Skrell come from the star system known as Qerr'Vallis, which translates
	to 'Star of the royals' or 'Light of the Crown'.

	Skrell are a highly advanced and logical race who live under the rule  of the Qerr'Katish, a
	caste within their society which keeps the empire of the Skrell running smoothly.  Skrell are
	herbivores on the whole and tend to be co-operative with the other species of the galaxy, although
	they rarely reveal the secrets of their empire to their allies.
