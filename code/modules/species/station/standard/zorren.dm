	The fox-like Zorren are native to Virgo-Prime, however there are two distinct varieties of Zorren one with large ears and shorter fur,

	hired by the Trans-Stellar Corporations. The other variety of Zorren are known as Highland Zorren as they frequently settle in hilly and/or
	mountainous areas, they have a differing societal structure than the Flatland Zorren having a more feudal social structure, like the Flatland Zorren,
