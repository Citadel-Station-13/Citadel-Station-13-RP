	Nevreans are a race of avian and dinosaur-like creatures living on Tal. They belong to a group of races that hails from Eltus,
	in the Vilous system. Unlike sergals whom they share a star system with, their species is a very peaceful one. They possess remarkable
	intelligence and very skillful hands that are put use for constructing precision instruments, but tire-out fast when repeatedly working
	over and over again. Consequently, they struggle to make copies of same things. Both genders have a voice that echoes a lot. Their natural
	tone oscillates between tenor and soprano. They are excessively noisy when they quarrel in their native language.
