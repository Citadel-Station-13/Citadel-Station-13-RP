		The Dnin-Nepids are a nomadic species hailing from the southern side of the Milky Way. A relatively new contender
		to the galaxy's state of affairs, they are a nomadic and innovative race that tends to stick to themselves. Dnin-Nepids
		often sport lithe, yet nimble bodies - covered with fuzz and sporting wings and antennae, leading them to gain the
		moniker of 'moths' due to their resemblence to a certain Earth-originating insect.

		While most of the Dnin-Nepids live aboard their arkships - whether within their main fleets, or as part of an expeditionary crew,
		more and more have been spotted on the frontier - oft either seeking a new adventure, or a new life amongst the other races of the galaxy.
		As a race of natural, if enigmatic and unpredictable engineers, they are oft found working aboard vessels as navigators and maintainers,
		taking advantage of their adaptability where they lack in things like brawn and numbers.
