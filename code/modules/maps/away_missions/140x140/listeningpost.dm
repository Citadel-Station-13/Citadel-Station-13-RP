// Lore Team Note:
// So, this file originally had a lot of like, weird Virgo setting stuff in it. It was too different from our own setting lore to keep, so I've wiped the file beyond this point.
// Going forward, I think we can still utilize the framework that was built here for something interesting. In a manner similar to Oculum Journalist interviews, we can select
// ghost players to take on the Listening Post role for extended RP, and ask them to write up reports. Those reports can then be filed here to establish our own chronology that
// doesn't involve real life Santa and Space Nazis fighting Quentin Tarantino characters. - Captain
