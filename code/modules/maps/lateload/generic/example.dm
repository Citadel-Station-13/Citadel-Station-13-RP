	desc = "A completely generic and unassuming planet"
	/// ^ The description of the planet. Is only seen by admins if they manually load in a planet, dont be
	/// too verbose. For changing what people see in game when they scan it you will need to edit the overmap effect itself

	/// Z level flags. Similiar to traits except they control a couple different things. These two are what you are likely going
	/// to be using a lot. MAP_LEVEL_CONTACT means you will be able to hear station alerts and such. MAP_LEVEL_PLAYER simply tells
	/// the z level that players will likely be on the z level. Check out maps.dm for more information
