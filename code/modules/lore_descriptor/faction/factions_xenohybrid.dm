	You are the result of one of these nights. At least one of your parents is related to a Xenomorph, probably over a bunch of corners.\
	Many Xenohybrids live among the humans in the orion confederacy. You are one of them."

		And even though relatively new to the galactic scene, the family heads knew how to leverage that fairly decently,\
		ensuring wealth for the generations to come. You were born to the neomorph family, or one of its many offshoots somewhere in the galaxy."

	killing it in the process. But you aren't one anymore. Someone made you see sense in all of that bloodshed and torture, someone made you see yourself.\
	And now you are in a completely new world, in a society were everything isnt the hive, and what you want matters. Make the best of it."
