	description = "Ver-Theim left behind multiple abandoned colony worlds. Those planets are inhospitable to most organic races, with their atmospheres being mainly composed out of Chlorine and Nitrogen. All Colony Worlds appear to have been left behind days before their discovery, with Architecture being untouched by Flora and Fauna on the planet."
