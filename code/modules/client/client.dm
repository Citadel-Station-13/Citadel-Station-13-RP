/**
 * Client datum
 *
 * A datum that is created whenever a user joins a BYOND world, one will exist for every active connected
 * player
 *
 * when they first connect, this client object is created and [/client/New] is called
 *
 * When they disconnect, this client object is deleted and [/client/Del] is called
 *
 * All client topic calls go through [/client/Topic] first, so a lot of our specialised
 * topic handling starts here
 */
/client

	/**
	 * This line makes clients parent type be a datum
	 *
	 * By default in byond if you define a proc on datums, that proc will exist on nearly every single type
	 * from icons to images to atoms to mobs to objs to turfs to areas, it won't however, appear on client
	 *
	 * instead by default they act like their own independent type so while you can do istype(icon, /datum)
	 * and have it return true, you can't do istype(client, /datum), it will always return false.
	 *
	 * This makes writing oo code hard, when you have to consider this extra special case
	 *
	 * This line prevents that, and has never appeared to cause any ill effects, while saving us an extra
	 * pain to think about
	 *
	 * This line is widely considered black fucking magic, and the fact it works is a puzzle to everyone
	 * involved, including the current engine developer, lummox
	 *
	 * If you are a future developer and the engine source is now available and you can explain why this
	 * is the way it is, please do update this comment
