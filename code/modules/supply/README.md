# Cargo Module

The game's Supply and Cargo systems with their related things live here.

While this can somewhat be associated with Cargo, remember that the station is not the only one with a supply controller.

- supply - the supply buy/sell system, which is literally just an IC way for the game world to spawn/delete things for this abstract thing we call 'money'

More modules to come.
