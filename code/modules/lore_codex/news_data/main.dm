	name = "Nanotrasen Acquires Three Worlds from People's Republic of Adhomai! Insult to revolution or savy political move? -  6/19/2563"
	data = "Today Nanotrasen announced that is had purchased three systems from the People's Republic of Adhomai (PRA), a move widely mocked by the Republic's rivals on Adhomai.\
	The three planets Lythios-43, Miaphus, and Motov were 'settled' as penal colonies in the late 2530's and early 2540's. Since then these three systems have been a drain on the \
	resources of the PRA. The meagre mines and resources of the three worlds along with their meagre forced laborer population could not hope to cover the costs of maintaining \
	the distant colonies. The final straw came for the colonies when in 2557 a experimental reactor in a weapons testing facility on Lythios-43c suffered a catastrophic meltdown.\
	With hundreds injured and dozens dead from the meltdown, the PRA vowed to close the facility and in 2560 the Lythios last Tajaran personelle left Lythios-43c abandoning the planet.\
	<br><br>\
	Shortly after, the PRA entered negotations with Nanotrasen over the rights to the three worlds after similar high profile disasters occured in Miaphus and Motov systems.\
	The deal was made public last week, when documents detailing the arrangement were leaked to the independent press on Adhomai by anonamous source. In total, Nanotrasen has \
	acquired the two colonies Miaphus'irra, a scorching desert world, and Motov'maal, an icy planet witha subterrainian ocean respectively, various outposts orbiting the Motov,\
	Miaphus and Lythios-43, along with the estimated fifty thousand Tajaran penal colonists within. Nanotrasen has vowed to turn the colonies into prosperous frontier societies,\
	freeing the former laborers and offering them all gainful employment within the company.\
	<br><br>\
	On Adhomai however the sale has been met with mass mockery. The New Kingdom of Adhomai and Democratic Republic of Adhomai have both issued scathing criticism of the PRA \
	mocking their lack of commitment to the revolutionary values they claim to strive for not only selling their planets to foriegners but a foriegn megacorporation.\
	The media on Adhomai aside from PRA controlled channels have given non-stop coverage of the incident which has provided almost endless fodder for the comedians across \
	the snowy hoemworld of the Tajaran people. The PRA in response annouce their 'partnership' with Nanotrasen relating to the system earlier today in a blatant attempt to \
	save face.\
	<br><br>\
	Nanotrasen for its part has begun preparing to take over the facilities they ahve purchased from the PRA. One of its first priorities and part of the original deal with the PRA \
	is to take some measures to clean up the still heavily radioactive remains of the reactor site of Lythios-43c Nanotrasen considers the world a top priority for resource expoitation \
	and study and are eager to repurpose the remanents of the Tajaran base their into yet another of their countless surface bases. Similarly it hopes to ressume production on the mines \
	of Miaphus'irra and improve the aquaponics and geothermal facilities on Motov'maal, hoping to turn the former penal colonies around in a positive way.\

	This is a developing story please stay tuned for more updates."

	With the Moghes Hegemony and its Naramadi allies already boasting the largest navy in the galaxy by tonnage the new drydock is seen as a escalation \
	of their already growing military power. Orion Confederation officals have already condemned the build up citing the new drydock as only exsascerbating tensions \
	between the Hegemony and the rest of the galaxy. There has been no response from the Hegemony or the Naramadi Ascendency as of yet continuing their tradition of cold silence \
	towards Orion diplomatic overtures. The Vikara combine has responded in a more restained manner simply acknowledging the current construction of the new dockyard \
	and that is unlikely to change their current diplomatic policy towards the Hegemony.\

	Political analysts fear the continuing slow escalation between Hegemony and the rest of the galaxy, stating that inevitably the slaving empire will be drawn into \

	Seemingly intent on wholesale slaughter, the pirates moved from town to town, farmstead to farmstead, and killed all in their path.\

	Salvation for the survivors arrived on the night of 9/6/2564 when a Nanotrasen Exploratory Fleet passing through the system performed a routine scouting run on the planet. \

	actions in hopes to seize vessels, stations or thier cargos. Though initially highly effective, Nanotrasen's own medical staff was able to rise against this \
	new threat and was able to devise an effective antifungal treatment in a matter of months since the first reports of the infection. Unfortunately the rapid \
	spread of the fungal infection, and its quick lethality meant that many stations were often crippled by the infection and countless NT employess died from \
	the aggressive fungal bioweweapon. With the effectiveness of the weapon diminishing due to NT's treatments Cybersun ultimately moved its remaining stockpile \
	of Fungal Tuberculois and their dispersal devices into storage shortly a few years before Cybersun Industries and the Syndicate dissolved entirely \
	signaling an end to the phoron wars. \
	<br><br>\
	Since the end of phoron wars incidents like the tragedy on Rzhavoye-Zoloto have not been entirely unheard of. Cybersun's rapid dissolution, alongside the collapse of its \
	allies such as the Gorlex Manufacturing Corporation, saw countless stockpiles of Syndicate Nuclear Biological and Chemical weaponry disappear as they were either \
	hidden, destroyed, sold or perhaps even simply forgotten about. With the spread of Nanotrasen's antifungal counter to fungal TB and Zeng-Hu Pharmaceutical's own \
	incorporation of  similarly effective anti-fungal agents into their own mass market drugs, deaths from Fungal Tuberculois are now thankfully rare, and with \
	fewer and fewer samples of the weapon floating about the galaxy, many hope that this grim reminder of the phoron wars will soon only exist in labortories."

	data = "With the frontier colonies being more spread out as ever, Piracy is growing rampart in those territories. While Megacorporations such as Nanotrasen, \
	Hepastheus and even Necropolis Industries might protect certain trade routes neccessary for their continued prosperity, it was always assumed that \
	the three major Galactic powers, that being the Orion Confederacy, Moghes Hegemony and Vikara Combine, will protect that major hyperspace routes from dangers. \
	That, however, has been proven not to be the case. \
	<br><br>\
	In recent days there was a major spike in Pirate activity on lanes connecting Orion Confederacy and it's frontiers, as well as the Hegemony and the Combine. \
	With the amount of pirate raids increasing, most free traders do not dare cross the Temhoser gate, the so called 'bottleneck' in Hyperlanes leading into \
	the Hegemony from Galactic south or follow the ill-protected Eastern Highways into the Vikara Combine. \
	<br><br>\
	It was reported by many of our readers in the Western frontier that a large group of pirates has made their camp right outside the Temhöser gate, \
	awaiting any ship to approach the nearest re-fueling station just to strike them unaware. Moghes Hegemony advises all traders and travellers to choose the \
	longer, yet more protected, route going near the galactic core if they want to reach their trade ports. \
	<br><br>\
	Orion Confederacy and Vikara Combine are promising that they will combine their available forces into a Joint Operations team to hunt down \
	any pirate fleets camping near the galactic highways, however our anonymous contact within Combine Armed Forces suggests that said \
	operation will not be ready until early 2567. \
	<br><br>\
	And for those curious about the Hegemony response, the Naramadi Ascendancy has put out a statement after they suffered a major blow - loss of \
	Inkinira viator Galvus and the Council of Elders for House Galvus.  The statement is as follows:\
	<br>\
	'The despicable actions of pirates preying on unprepared vessels attempting to enter and leave the Hegemony space have never been our point of focus, \
	until they have decided to take something dear to us, Inkinira viator Galvus, a beloved Matriarch, Mother to many and the eldest viator this landsmeet \
	had the honour to host. As only aggression has been shown to us, We will respond in kind. The Third and Sixth fleets are being mobilised, together with \
	the Fifth and Sixth legions. We will not stop untill her killers are brought to justice.'\
	<br><br>\
	The response of the Naramadi Ascendancy was called '... A show of power, and a poor one at that' by the Confederacy high command, and the Moghes Kingdoms \
	offer no official military support, however they reportedly allow 'volunteers' to join the Fleets in their quest to hunt down the pirates. \
	<br><br>\
	In closing words, We need to expect price increases in various luxury goods and raw materials coming from outside the Orion Confederacy. With piracy on the rise, \
	not many traders and transport corporations are willing to risk loosing their ships, and cargo, in wild space, and those that do often raise their prices to be \
	able to pay for their security staff."

	Dysterhet's seat on the Confederation marking the first time a Xenomorph Hybrid has ever held a seat in the highest halls of the Orion Confederation \
	outside the Neomorph homeworld of Berkaugen. \
	<br><br>\
	The lonely system of Enshamet is a mere ten light years from Dysterhet, the star Berkaugen. Its only populated world is the Traskherren a world known \
	for its acid rains and slightly chlorinated atmosphere. The conditions on the surface were hostile to human life however they proved valuable for \
	both mining and research the unique atmosphere being host to variety of specialized flora and micro organisms. The unique atmosphere and pletniful acid \
	also made certain chemical processes very effecient which lead to the first permanent settlements on the planet, which were funded by Zheng-Hu Pharmaceuticals. \
	Though the atmosphere was toxic to humans xenohybrids had no trouble in it and their chitin made them resistant to the acid rains of the planet. Zheng-Hu \
	encouraged migration of Neomorphs from Berkaugen to Traskherren. Upon the admission of Traskherren to the Orion Confederation thirty years ago Neomorphs \
	made up almost 40% of Traskherren's population. \
	<br><br>\
	Melanippe's Canididacy on Traskherren was a close faught campaign. Traskherren politics had been largely dominated by Zheng-Hu Pharmaceuticals with \
	their Orion representative being the Zheng-Hu endorsed candidate since the world's admission to the Confederation. Melanippe challenged the nearly two \
	decade long incumbent candidate Zhou Yingkun. After two decades Yingkun despite his Zheng-Hu backing had become increasing unpopular due to his \
	economic policies being seen as favorable only to his Zheng-Hu backers. His campaign against Melanippe was marred by personal attacks towards the \
	hybrid asking if she could truly represent the entire system rather than just the interests of the Neomorph hives of Traskherren. Despite this though\
	Melanippe was able to gain enough support from the non-Neomorph population to win a narrow victory on Traskherren with 52% of the vote. \
	<br><br>\
	Melanippe has recieved a warm welcome already from many council members,her membership was soon faced with a problem in that the standardized \
	sized seats in the Confederation halls would be too small for the three and half meter tall Praetorian. Until a properly sized seat can be secured \
	and the council chamber rearranged to accommodate her, Melanippe will have to attend Council meetings through holocall. During her victory speech Melanippe \
	promised to not only represent everyone on Traskherren not just Xenohybrid population. She reiterated her campaign to see the corporate investments on Taskherren \
	diversified beyond its roots as a Zheng-Hu backed colony and more infastructure funding for frontier planets like Traskhassen. Melanippe's future with Orion remains \
	to be seen but Xenohybrid activists across Orion have celebrated her election saying it is but another victory in their battle to find acceptance not just with \
	the Orion Confederation but the galaxy as a whole. Melanippe is expected to take her seat, even if only in hologram form. by June."

	canidates for the title of Crown Prince, would formally announce their candidacy. With over a dozen potential canidates among the eligible nephews and grandsons \
	of King Arzthram many already having signifcant backing among the New Kingdom's noble class it was bound to be a busy event where each of the princes \
	would be trying their best to stand out. However, one young prince has stolen the spotlight during the conference, the Luna educated prince Volink Azunja son of \
	King Arzthram's youngest brother. \
	<br><br>\
	The prince's initial annoucement of his candidacy originally was almost ignored, the young prince was written off as being far too \
	progressive and full of alien ideas to be a serious contender for the crown in the conservative New Kingdom. Volink's presentation today however, greatly shifted \
	the balance of power of court. Rather than being flanked by a small cadre of his supporters while presenting himself to the King he was escorted to the throne by a \
	formation of 'knights' armored in shining RiGs and armed with energy shields and metamaterial swords. The knights later revealed to be the sons of many lower ranking \
	nobles currently serving in the New Kingom Royal Navy, shocked the court. Indeed Volink was accused of violating the laws of the courts, however the Prince quickly \
	pointed out that it is the tradition that Knights of Noble blood should not be deprived of their swords or shields even in the presence of their king as it is their\
	right to bear these arms, a rule which dates back to even before the cataclysmic sudden onset iceage that was the Great Frost of Adhomai.\
	<br><br>\
	The Prince's gambit seems to be have successful. Already he has courted many undecided nobles and won over many progressives within the noble houses. Among the frontrunners \
	for the title of crown prince, Volink remains the youngest, a criticism he has noted. Addressing the critiques to his candidacy Volink made the following annoucement: \
	<br><br>\
	'For those that accuse me of seeking to upend the kingdom and its noble traditions with alien ideas, I bid you look to the noble sons of Adhomai to by sides: Are they not familar to you? \
	You have seen them in ancient tales of heroism of times before the Frost, before the Revolution, when S'rendarr's warmth still coated this planet in green. Indeed every child of \
	Adhomai knows the stories of knights who reigned before the Frost, whose nobility was so legendary that it laid the foundations of the nobility we all treasure today. I am not \
	abandoning our noble traditions for alien ideas, no I seek to return Adhomai to that ancient nobility lost in the snows of the Great Frost. The New Kingdom will become a beacon \
	of that nobility, not just for the people of the New Kingdom but for all Tajara. Like Srendarr pulls the worthy from the fields of Messa, I vow to lift all Tajara from the \
	darkness of this new age, til the old nobility lost in the snow of the Great Frost shines not just on Adhomai but across the galaxy. As for those who say I am unproven I assure them \

	<br><br>\
	As an exclusive piece of evidence, the last diary page of Tartic was recovered. It, too, speaks of the betrayal the former Captain was already suspecting. \
	'Damn You Three Fingers! How much did they pay you to betray me! Who payed you to betray me! Was it the fucking CATS!!! No it was not the cats wasn't it,' writes Tartic. \
	<br><br>\
	Though no body was recovered both the testimony of the captured pirates and eveidence recovered from their hideout was enough to evidence for both the New Kingdom and \
	Nanotrasen to agree that the Catskinner, who has terrorized the Tajara people for fourty years, has finally met his demise. With the vast majority of his crew now either \
	dead or imprisoned, and his surviving lieutenants now awaiting trial on Adhomai, the Tajaran people can rest easy knowing that this terror has finally met his end."

	data = "Following Nanotrasen's lessen then stellar performance at the earning meeting last month, investors were hoping for good news this month from their competitors. Unforunately, \
	revenue misses were abound for the Galaxy's megacorporations. Markets across Orion began selling ranging from Zheng-Hu's (ZHP) modest 1.06% drop to Aether's (AAR) 4.32% wipeout. Still the \
	worst news remains for Nanotrasen whose is down a whole 8.5% since today last month. Many are beginning to fear the dawn of an galaxy spawning recession. Economists are not so sure however \
	citing the still positive growth across the sector they regard the current situation as simply a slowdown that will be corrected with time. With many corporations looking to make hefty \
	investments in securing new resources on the Frontier however many investors fear the drops in profit will only get worse before they get better. 'What do I need that they haven't already \
	sold me?' says Doctor Pierre Passeau PhD of Ecomonics, University of Selene, Luna. 'Nanotrasen the model for the modern megacorp was only able to make sure good returns because it was able \
	to discover things that we didn't know we needed yet, phoron and synthetic bluespace crystals. However the galaxy isn't so big anymore and more of it we explore the more we realize that there \
	is not going to be another phoron out there to come and solve our economic problems. Corporations and investors need to learn to lower their expectations we won't be seeing new markets opening \
	for a long time, not unless Nanotrasen or someone else finds something really new to sell us'. Perhaps that is what Nanotrasen hopes by sending their plans to send explorers out into deep frontier \
	space. Either way it seems no matter how to spin it, the post phoron war boom is finally as an end, whether there will be a bust too remains to be seen."

	data = "Following his capture of the infamous Ssizikar Tartic, Prince Volink Azunja has returned to Adhomai a hero. His victory has drawn congratulations from all corners of Adhomian society \
	as all corners of Adhomai are satisfied that the pirate lord responsible for the deaths of thousands of Tajara has finally met justice. Though his victory has also seen criticism from the \
	New Kingdom's rivals and the Confederate Commonwealth, with the People's Republic of Adhomai cautioning against attributing the victory to the Prince stating instead it belongs to the \
	people of Adhomai as a whole. Similarly the Confederate Commonwealth has criticized the solo nature of the New Kingdom Naval operation that brought down Tartic's fleet, stressing the \
	need of all Tajara powers to work together to face their mutual enemies among the stars. Still within the New Kingdom Volink's victory has seen as a symbol of the growing power of the \
	New Kingdom's fledgling fleet and the continued modernization of their society. \
	<br><br>\
	It seems that the Prince's efforts are being richly rewards as today with the aging King Arzthram Azunja officially annouced that the Prince, the son of his youngest brother, \
	is to be the new Crown Prince, following the death fo the King's only son Prince Thram in March. An official ceremony is scheduled to take place sometime in August. \
	In a short release to the press the Prince thanked S'rendarr, his uncle the King, and the marines and spacers who fought with him agianst Tartic. He vowed that his reign \
	will not abandon the sacred traditions of the New Kingdom but 'banish the darkness of Mesa that has clouded this kingdom for too long' and 'bring the Kingdom of Adhomai \
	into a new bright golden age within the light of the S'rendarr' and finally to 'spread that light to the far corners of the galaxy so all Tajara can bask in its glow!'. \
	<br><br>\
	The annoucement of Volink's appointment through only muted diplomatic reactions form galactic powers, however is rumors are to be believed the young prince is already making \
	alliances and with Nanotrasen. The Prince following his appointment annouced new trading arrangements with the company today perhaps making the New Kingdom the most Nanotrasen \
	friendly power on the face of Adhomai. However, this is not the unequal exploitative treaties Adhomai is used to. Diplomats have been shocked by the concessions Nanotrasen has given \
	in the deal. Whether this deal was simply a hard driven fluke or the start of a new age of cooperation between the Kingdom and megacorporations remains to be seen however for now \
	Nanotrasen is expected to take and train New Kingdom peasants as workers, skills that will no doubt aid in the development of the New Kingdom's archaic economy. Perhaps for once in \
	this kingdom out of time things are looking up, though with Nanotrasen involved one can only wonder the true price."

	data = "KT-943 also known as 'Surt' was once a Nanotrasen possesion of little repute among the stars. Once thought to be the home of nothing more than the ruins of a lost \
	civilization it was revealed that the bronze aged natives dubbed 'Scorians' by Nanotrasen had survied the cataclysmic volcanic eruptions that were thought to have wiped \
	out their fledgeling species. The natives, now living beneath the surface, have retained a complex bronze age society herding the dangerous native fauna with as much ease \
	as frontier spacers herd cattle. This civilization can consider itself lucky beyond most races of the galaxy and recently they have survived a second calamity that almost \
	spelt their extinction and this time the threat did not come from their own world but from the stars itself. \
	<br><br>\
	On July 8th, a meteor containing a hive of xenomorphs hit Surt and disgorged its chitinous invaders onto the planet. From there the infestation preyed on local fauna \
	absorbing thier DNA to adapt to the fiery surface or Surt breeding even deadlier xenomorph races. Nanotrasen quickly spring into action, desperate to protect the mineral and \
	anthropoligcal wealth of Surt. Thanks to the quick action of the Nanotrasen the initial hive was dispersed before it could begin gathering victims to spread the xenomorph \
	menace across the planet. However, some xenos escaped and over the past month Nanotrasen has been fighting a tireless campaign to eliminate them. \
	<br><br>\
	On the 29th of July Nanotrasen launched a massive operation that ended in the slaying of the new Queen of the Xenomorphs and the destruction of most of the xenos of the planet. \
	This time however there was no where the xenos could escape to. Today Nanotrasen annouced that they had successfully cleared the planet of Xenomorphs. A Nanotrasen representative \
	had this to say: 'It is not simply oue assets we have protected on Surt but, an entire sapient species. Science cannot being to predict the countless primtive civilization that \
	have been destroyed by the xenomorphs and thankfully the Scori will not joiningg that list. Despite our reputation as a profit first company, we recognize its part of our duty \
	as sapient life to protect the well being of other sapient life, even if it can be a bit pricey at times.' The Orion Confederation Institute of Anthropology formally thanks \
	Nanotrasen for helping perserve the Scorian culture and expressed interest in further exploration fo Surt and its people. Though they, hestitated to use the word uplift they \
	acknowledge that the Scori's integration with the galaxy is at this point inevitable even if they hoped it would be no time soon. At least the Scori then can rest easy perhaps \
	never knowing how close they came to extinction yet again."

	data = "Yesterday in the Frontier a massive cyber attack occured effecting an entire sector. Positronic intelligences, drones, ship AIs and all even MMI units were all said to \
	be infected by a malignant virus that was spread across the sector through subspace relays. Subverted silicons from the simplest drone to ship AIs were driven to stockpile materials \
	to fuel corrupted drone fabricators which then began producing armies of corrupted drones. Infected units were also compelled to construct communication systems which transmitted \
	data back towards what can almost be assumed to be the source of the virus. Casulties are thankfully limited however for Hephaestus Industries, who relies heavily on its drone \
	employees,the loss of life and destruction of assests is thought to be immense. \
	<br><br>\
	A Hephaestus Industry vessel, HIV Tungsten Heart, has been reportedly been completely siezed by its subverted silicon crew, its organic crew thought to already be \
	slaughtered. The now rogue vessel, was home to several drone fabrication facilities and to make matters worse, the databases of the fabricators allegedly contain blueprints \
	for an as of yet unreleased line of Hephaestus combat drones! These 'Warhound' series combat drones are armed with a variety of powerful mounted weapons meant to make short work \
	of pirate threats. It can only be assumed that Tungsten Heart has become the center of an omincidal synthetic intelligence. Though the ship lacks weapons of its own, its fabricators \
	are no doubt working tirelessly to create a silicon army. The entire sector and surrounding regions have been placed on high alert with SDF, mercenary, and corporate security \
	working together to locate and eliminate the Tungsten Heart before it can threaten colonies in the region. \
	<br><br>\
	Back in Sol, the Orion Confederation has placed its own subspace relays under increased security with many neighboring regions following suit. Already synth units that have survived \
	infection from the malignant code are being studied to figure out how to better counter this mysterious virus in the future. For now all civilian vessels are instructed to block \
	all subspace packet transmissions over a certain size and to report any sightings of the Tungsten Heart to the SDF immediately. Synthetics are also advised to check with their \
	software engineers for signs of system tampering and to update their system security software at the earliest opporutunity. Despite the damage caused by the cyber attacks, software \
	engineers are confident that such an attacks will be rarer and rarer in the future as robotics technology improves and positronics become more independent. However, with the \
	increasing scale of cyber attacks, other experts worry that a worst case scenario mass synthetic subversion simply has yet to occur."
