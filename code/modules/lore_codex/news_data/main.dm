	name = "Nanotrasen Acquires Three Systems from People's Republic of Adhomai! Insult to revolution or savy political move? -  6/19/2563"
	data = "Today Nanotrasen announced that is had purchased three systems from the People's Republic of Adhomai (PRA), a move widely mocked by the Republic's rivals on Adhomai.\
	The three systems Lythios-43, Miaphus, and Motov were 'settled' as penal colonies in the late 2530's and early 2540's. Since the three systems have been a drain on the \
	resources of the PRA as the meagre mines and resources of the three systems along with their meagre forced laborer population could not hope to cover the costs of maintaining \
	the distant colonies. The final straw came for the colonies when in 2557 a experimental reactor in a weapons testing facility on Lythios-43c suffered a catastrophic meltdown.\
	With hundreds injured and dozens dead from the meltdown, the PRA vowed to close the facility and in 2560 the Lythios last Tajaran personelle left Lythios-43c abandoning the system.\
	<br><br>\
	Shortly after, the PRA entered negotations with Nanotrasen over the rights to the three systems after similar high profile disasters occured in Miaphus and Motov systems.\
	The deal was made public last week, when documents detailing the arrangement were leaked to the independent press on Adhomai by anonamous source. In total, Nanotrasen has \
	acquired the two colonies Miaphus'irra, a scorching desert world, and Motov'maal, an icy planet witha subterraiian ocean respectively, various outposts within the Motov,\
	Miaphus and Lythios-43 systems, along with the esimtated fifty thousand ajaran penal colonists within. Nanotrasen has vowed to turn the colonies into prosperous frontier societies,\
	freeing the former laborers and offering them all gainful employment within the company.\
	<br><br>\
	On Adhomai however the sale has been met with mass mockery. The New Kingdom of Adhomai and Democratic Republic of Adhomai have both issued scathing criticism of the PRA \
	mocking their lack of commitment to the revolutionary values they claim to strive for not only selling their planets to foriegners but a foriegn megacorporation.\
	The media on Adhomai aside from PRA controlled channels have given non-stop coverage of the incident which has provided almost endless fodder for the comedians across \
	the snowy hoemworld of the Tajaran people. The PRA in response annouce their 'partnership' with Nanotrasen relating to the system earlier today in a blatant attempt to \
	save face.\
	<br><br>\
	Nanotrasen for its part has begun preparing to take over the facilities they ahve purchased from the PRA. One of its first priorities and part of the original deal with the PRA \
	is to take some measures to clean up the still heavily radioactive remains of the reactor site of Lythios-43c Nanotrasen considers the world a top priority for resource expoitation \
	and study and are eager to repurpose the remanents of the Tajaran base their into yet another of their countless surface bases. Similarly it hopes to ressume production on the mines \
	of Miaphus'irra and improve the aquaponics and geothermal facilities on Motov'maal, hoping to turn the former penal colonies around in a positive way.\

	This is a developing story please stay tuned for more updates."

	With the Moghes Hegemony and its Naramadi allies already boasting the largest navy in the galaxy by tonnage the new drydock is seen as a escalation \
	of their already growing military power. Orion Confederation officals have already condemned the build up citing the new drydock as only exsascerbating tensions \
	between the Hegemony and the rest of the galaxy. There has been no response from the Hegemony or the Naramadi Ascendency as of yet continuing their tradition of cold silence \
	towards Orion diplomatic overtures. The Vikara combine has responded in a more restained manner simply acknowledging the current construction of the new dockyard \
	and that is unlikely to change their current diplomatic policy towards the Hegemony.\
	<br><br>\
	Political analysts fear the continuing slow escalation between Hegemony and the rest of the galaxy, stating that inevitably the slaving empire will be drawn into \
	conflict with larger neighbors after it runs out of easy opponents. Military analysts are adamant of the increasing need for the Orion Confederation to increase its own \
	military spending and to reorganize its byzantine command structures claiming the current navy of Orion would stand no chance should the Hegemony invade in force.\

	was thrust into the forefront of the Galactic stage! Its people's abject poverty and lack of wealth did nothing to spare them from the wrath of an as of yet,\
	unidentified group of pirates. Sometime earlier in the month these pirates descended upon the poor citizens of Mescalero and unleashed an overwhelming orgy of violence.\
	Seemingly intent on wholesale slaughter, the pirates moved from town to town, farmstead to farmstead, and killed all in their path.\
	<br><br>\
	Salvation for the survivors arrived on the night of 9/6/2564 when a NanoTrasen Exploratory Fleet passing through the system performed a routine scouting run on the planet. \
	An NT Official who asked to remain anonymous reported that scouts from the NSV Triumph were the first on scene, where they engaged in a mighty firefight with the pirates. \
	After destroying a vital command post, the scouting party withdrew and Emergency Response Teams were dispatched to remove the remaining pirate presence. Survivors rescued \
	by the ERTs numbered in the hundreds, with the majority of the planet's inhabitants having fallen victim to the merciless onslaught. Most of the survivors are currently \
	receiving psychological care for the traumatic experiences they were forced to endure. The identity of the particular group of pirates responsible for this act is still \

	the planets along with the Lythios-43 system from the PRA in 2562 and since then been in deep negotiations with the former penal laborers \
	over the creation of civilian governments in the former colonies. Nanotrasen in a public statement expressed optimism that their relationship \
