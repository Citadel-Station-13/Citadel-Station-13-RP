	data = "Today Nanotrasen announced that is had purchased the Lythios 43 system from the People's Republic of Adhomai (PRA), a move widely mocked by the Republic's rivals on Adhomai.\
	The system was claimed when the PRA 'settled' the planet of Miaphus'irra as a pneal colony in the late 2530'. Since then the systems has been a drain on the \
	resources of the PRA. The meagre mines and resources of Miaphus'irra along with their meagre forced laborer population could not hope to cover the costs of maintaining \
	the distant colony. The final straw came for the colonies when in 2557 a experimental reactor in a weapons testing facility on Lythios-43c another world in the same system, suffered a catastrophic meltdown.\
	With hundreds injured and dozens dead from the meltdown, the PRA vowed to close the facility and in 2560 the Lythios last PRA military personelle left Lythios-43c abandoning the planet.\
	<br><br>\
	Shortly after, the PRA entered negotations with Nanotrasen over the rights to the Lythios 43 system after similar high profile mining disaster occured on Miaphus'irra.\
	The deal was made public last week, when documents detailing the arrangement were leaked to the independent press on Adhomai by anonamous source. In total, Nanotrasen has \
	acquired the planet of Miaphus'irra, a and all PRA assests on the planet. This apparently includes responsibility gor the estimated fifty thousand Tajaran penal colonists within. \
	Nanotrasen has vowed to turn the colonies into prosperous frontier societies, freeing the former laborers and offering them all gainful employment within the company.\
	<br><br>\
	On Adhomai however the sale has been met with mass mockery. The New Kingdom of Adhomai and Democratic Republic of Adhomai have both issued scathing criticism of the PRA \
	mocking their lack of commitment to the revolutionary values they claim to strive for not only selling their planets to foriegners but a foriegn megacorporation.\
	The media on Adhomai aside from PRA controlled channels have given non-stop coverage of the incident which has provided almost endless fodder for comedians across \
	the snowy hoemworld of the Tajaran people. The PRA in response annouced their 'partnership' with Nanotrasen relating to the systems earlier today in a blatant attempt to \
	save face.\
	<br><br>\
	Nanotrasen for its part has begun preparing to take over the facilities they have purchased from the PRA. One of its first priorities and part of the original deal with the PRA \
	is to take some measures to clean up the still heavily radioactive remains of the reactor site of Lythios-43c. Nanotrasen considers the world a top priority for resource expoitation \
	and reseach. They are apparently eager to repurpose the remanents of the Tajaran base their into yet another of their countless surface bases. Similarly it hopes to resume production on the mines \
	of Miaphus'irra hoping to turn the former penal colony around in a positive way.\

	With the Moghes Hegemony and its Naramadi allies already boasting the largest navy in the galaxy by tonnage the new drydock is seen as a escalation \
	of their already growing military power. Orion Confederation officals have already condemned the build up citing the new drydock as only exasperating tensions \
	between the Hegemony and the rest of the galaxy. There has been no response from the Hegemony or the Naramadi Ascendency as of yet continuing their tradition of cold silence \
	towards Orion diplomatic overtures. The Vikara Combine has responded in a more restained manner simply acknowledging the current construction of the new dockyard \
	and that is unlikely to change their current diplomatic policy towards the Hegemony.\

	Political analysts fear the continuing slow escalation between Hegemony and the rest of the galaxy, stating that inevitably the slaving empire will be drawn into \

	Seemingly intent on wholesale slaughter, the pirates moved from town to town, farmstead to farmstead, and killed all in their path.\

	Salvation for the survivors arrived on the night of 9/6/2564 when a Nanotrasen Exploratory Fleet passing through the system performed a routine scouting run on the planet. \

	any additional Syndicate assets still hidden in the belt, hoping to make sure that no addition Nuclear Biological or Chemical weapons are hidden in the region. \
	<br><br>\
	Fungal Tuberculois was developed by now defunct Cybersun Industries at the height of the Syndicate's war on Nanotrasen. The fungus, whose offical name has \
	been likely intentionally lost by its creators, was designed to infect station and starship ventilation systems rapidly spreading itself to an entire crew \
	undetected. Infected individuals would rapidly develop symptoms similar to late stage tuberculois infections. Victims often die coughing up blood as the fungus \
	rapidly eats away at their lungs. Cybersun and its Syndicate allies would often deploy the bioweapon on targets covertly shortly before launching boarding \
	actions in hopes to seize vessels, stations or thier cargos. Though initially highly effective, Nanotrasen's own medical staff was able to rise against this \
	new threat and was able to devise an effective antifungal treatment in a matter of months since the first reports of the infection. Unfortunately the rapid \
	spread of the fungal infection, and its quick lethality meant that many stations were often crippled by the infection and countless NT employess died from \
	the aggressive fungal bioweweapon. With the effectiveness of the weapon diminishing due to NT's treatments Cybersun ultimately moved its remaining stockpile \
	of Fungal Tuberculois and their dispersal devices into storage shortly a few years before Cybersun Industries and the Syndicate dissolved entirely \
	signaling an end to the phoron wars. \
	<br><br>\
	Since the end of phoron wars incidents like the tragedy on Rzhavoye-Zoloto have not been entirely unheard of. Cybersun's rapid dissolution, alongside the collapse of its \
	allies such as the Gorlex Manufacturing Corporation, saw countless stockpiles of Syndicate Nuclear Biological and Chemical weaponry disappear as they were either \
	hidden, destroyed, sold or perhaps even simply forgotten about. With the spread of Nanotrasen's antifungal counter to fungal TB and Zeng-Hu Pharmaceutical's own \
	incorporation of  similarly effective anti-fungal agents into their own mass market drugs, deaths from Fungal Tuberculois are now thankfully rare, and with \
	fewer and fewer samples of the weapon floating about the galaxy, many hope that this grim reminder of the phoron wars will soon only exist in laboratories."

	data = "With the frontier colonies being more spread out as ever, Piracy is growing rampart in those territories. While Megacorporations such as Nanotrasen, \
	Hepastheus and even Necropolis Industries might protect certain trade routes neccessary for their continued prosperity, it was always assumed that \
	the three major Galactic powers, that being the Orion Confederacy, Moghes Hegemony and Vikara Combine, will protect that major hyperspace routes from dangers. \
	That, however, has been proven not to be the case. \
	<br><br>\
	In recent days there was a major spike in Pirate activity on lanes connecting Orion Confederacy and it's frontiers, as well as the Hegemony and the Combine. \
	With the amount of pirate raids increasing, most free traders do not dare cross the Temhoser gate, the so called 'bottleneck' in Hyperlanes leading into \
	the Hegemony from Galactic south or follow the ill-protected Eastern Highways into the Vikara Combine. \
	<br><br>\
	It was reported by many of our readers in the Western frontier that a large group of pirates has made their camp right outside the Temhöser gate, \
	awaiting any ship to approach the nearest re-fueling station just to strike them unaware. Moghes Hegemony advises all traders and travellers to choose the \
	longer, yet more protected, route going near the galactic core if they want to reach their trade ports. \
	<br><br>\
	Orion Confederacy and Vikara Combine are promising that they will combine their available forces into a Joint Operations team to hunt down \
	any pirate fleets camping near the galactic highways, however our anonymous contact within Combine Armed Forces suggests that said \
	operation will not be ready until early 2567. \
	<br><br>\
	And for those curious about the Hegemony response, the Naramadi Ascendancy has put out a statement after they suffered a major blow - loss of \
	Inkinira viator Galvus and the Council of Elders for House Galvus.  The statement is as follows:\
	<br>\
	'The despicable actions of pirates preying on unprepared vessels attempting to enter and leave the Hegemony space have never been our point of focus, \
	until they have decided to take something dear to us, Inkinira viator Galvus, a beloved Matriarch, Mother to many and the eldest viator this landsmeet \
	had the honour to host. As only aggression has been shown to us, We will respond in kind. The Third and Sixth fleets are being mobilised, together with \
	the Fifth and Sixth legions. We will not stop untill her killers are brought to justice.'\
	<br><br>\
	The response of the Naramadi Ascendancy was called '... A show of power, and a poor one at that' by the Confederacy high command, and the Moghes Kingdoms \
	offer no official military support, however they reportedly allow 'volunteers' to join the Fleets in their quest to hunt down the pirates. \
	<br><br>\
	In closing words, We need to expect price increases in various luxury goods and raw materials coming from outside the Orion Confederacy. With piracy on the rise, \
	not many traders and transport corporations are willing to risk loosing their ships, and cargo, in wild space, and those that do often raise their prices to be \
	able to pay for their security staff."

	Dysterhet's seat on the Confederation marking the first time a Xenomorph Hybrid has ever held a seat in the highest halls of the Orion Confederation \
	outside the Neomorph homeworld of Berkaugen. \
	<br><br>\
	The lonely system of Enshamet is a mere ten light years from Dysterhet, the star of Berkaugen. Its only populated world is Traskherren, a world known \
	for its acid rains and slightly chlorinated atmosphere. The conditions on the surface were hostile to human life however they proved valuable for \
	both mining and research the unique atmosphere being host to variety of specialized flora and micro organisms. The unique atmosphere and pletniful acid \
	also made certain chemical processes very effecient which lead to the first permanent settlements on the planet, which were funded by Zheng-Hu Pharmaceuticals. \
	Though the atmosphere was toxic to humans xenohybrids had no trouble in it and their chitin made them resistant to the acid rains of the planet. Zheng-Hu \
	encouraged migration of Neomorphs from Berkaugen to Traskherren. Upon the admission of Traskherren to the Orion Confederation thirty years ago Neomorphs \
	made up almost 40% of Traskherren's population. \
	<br><br>\
	Melanippe's Canididacy on Traskherren was a close faught campaign. Traskherren politics had been largely dominated by Zheng-Hu Pharmaceuticals with \
	their Orion representative being the Zheng-Hu endorsed candidate since the world's admission to the Confederation. Melanippe challenged the nearly two \
	decade long incumbent candidate Zhou Yingkun. After two decades Yingkun had become increasing unpopular due to his economic policies which were seen as \
	favorable only to his Zheng-Hu backers. His campaign against Melanippe was marred by personal attacks towards the \
	hybrid, asking if she could truly represent the entire system rather than just the interests of the Neomorph hives of Traskherren. Despite this though\
	Melanippe was able to gain enough support from the non-Neomorph population to win a narrow victory on Traskherren with 52% of the vote. \
	<br><br>\
	Melanippe has recieved a warm welcome already from many council members, her membership was soon faced with a problem in that the standardized \
	sized seats in the Confederation halls would be too small for the three and half meter tall Praetorian. Until a properly sized seat can be secured \
	and the council chamber rearranged to accommodate her, Melanippe will have to attend Council meetings through holocall. During her victory speech Melanippe \
	promised to not only represent everyone on Traskherren not just Xenohybrid population. She reiterated her campaign to see the corporate investments on Taskherren \
	diversified beyond its roots as a Zheng-Hu backed colony and more infastructure funding for frontier planets like Traskhassen. Melanippe's future with Orion remains \
	to be seen but Xenohybrid activists across Orion have celebrated her election saying it is but another victory in their battle to find acceptance not just with \
	the Orion Confederation but the galaxy as a whole. Melanippe is expected to take her seat, even if only in hologram form. by June."

	struggling Tajaran state. After almost a month of silence from King Arzthram Azunja, the King finally annouced a royal conferrence, in which potential \
	canidates for the title of Crown Prince, would formally announce their candidacy. With over a dozen potential canidates among the eligible nephews and grandsons \
	of King Arzthram many already having signifcant backing among the New Kingdom's noble class it was bound to be a busy event where each of the princes \
	would be trying their best to stand out. However, one young prince has stolen the spotlight during the conference, the Luna educated prince Volink Azunja son of \
	King Arzthram's youngest brother. \
	<br><br>\
	The prince's initial annoucement of his candidacy originally was almost ignored, the young prince was written off as being far too \
	progressive and full of alien ideas to be a serious contender for the crown in the conservative New Kingdom. Volink's presentation today however, greatly shifted \
	the balance of power of court. Rather than being flanked by a small cadre of his supporters while presenting himself to the King he was escorted to the throne by a \
	formation of 'knights' armored in shining RiGs and armed with energy shields and metamaterial swords. The equipment of the knights, who were later revealed to be the sons of many lower ranking \
	nobles currently serving in the New Kingom Royal Navy, shocked the court. Indeed Volink was accused of violating the laws of the courts, however the Prince quickly \
	pointed out that it is the tradition that Knights of Noble blood should not be deprived of their swords or shields even in the presence of their king, as it is their\
	right to bear these arms. This tradiation dates back to even before the cataclysmic sudden onset iceage that was the Great Frost of Adhomai.\
	<br><br>\
	The Prince's gambit seems to be have successful. Already he has courted many undecided nobles and won over many progressives within the noble houses. Among the frontrunners \
	for the title of crown prince, Volink remains the youngest, a criticism he has noted. Addressing the critiques to his candidacy Volink made the following annoucement: \
	<br><br>\
	'For those that accuse me of seeking to upend the kingdom and its noble traditions with alien ideas, I bid you look to the noble sons of Adhomai to by sides: Are they not familar to you? \
	You have seen them in ancient tales of heroism of times before the Frost, before the Revolution, when S'rendarr's warmth still coated this planet in green. Indeed every child of \
	Adhomai knows the stories of knights who reigned before the Frost, whose nobility was so legendary that it laid the foundations of the nobility we all treasure today. I am not \
	abandoning our noble traditions for alien ideas, no I seek to return Adhomai to that ancient nobility lost in the snows of the Great Frost. The New Kingdom will become a beacon \
	of that nobility, not just for the people of the New Kingdom but for all Tajara. Like Srendarr pulls the worthy from the fields of Messa, I vow to lift all Tajara from the \
	darkness of this new age, til the old nobility lost in the snow of the Great Frost shines not just on Adhomai but across the galaxy. As for those who say I am unproven I assure them \

	Tartic's defeat may finally spell the end of his long reign of terror over the Tajara, having first begun terrorizing them during their attempts to colonize Hro'zamal nearly four decades ago. \

	pursued by the New Kingdom and Nanotrasen The notorious pirate was allegedly dead before Nanotrasen forces even arrived. Former crew members, now on trial for piracy charges, \
	attested to a 'coup' or 'plot' within the hideout that resulted in the death of Tartic. \

	As an exclusive piece of evidence, the last diary page of Tartic was recovered. It, too, speaks of the betrayal the former Captain was already suspecting. \
	'Damn You Three Fingers! How much did they pay you to betray me! Who payed you to betray me! Was it the fucking CATS!!! No it was not the cats wasn't it,' writes Tartic. \

	Though no body was recovered both the testimony of the captured pirates and eveidence recovered from their hideout was enough to evidence for both the New Kingdom and \
	Nanotrasen to agree that the Catskinner, who has terrorized the Tajara people for fourty years, has finally met his demise. With the vast majority of his crew now either \
	dead or imprisoned, and his surviving lieutenants now awaiting trial on Adhomai, the Tajaran people can rest easy knowing that this terror has finally met his end."

	New Kingdom's rivals and the Confederate Commonwealth, with the People's Republic of Adhomai cautioning against attributing the victory to the Prince stating instead it belongs to the \
	people of Adhomai as a whole. Similarly the Confederate Commonwealth has criticized the solo nature of the New Kingdom Naval operation that brought down Tartic's fleet, stressing the \
	need of all Tajara powers to work together to face their mutual enemies among the stars. Still within the New Kingdom Volink's victory has seen as a symbol of the growing power of the \
	New Kingdom's fledgling fleet and the continued modernization of their society. \
	<br><br>\
	It seems that the Prince's efforts are being richly rewards as today with the aging King Arzthram Azunja officially annouced that the Prince, the son of his youngest brother, \
	is to be the new Crown Prince, following the death fo the King's only son Prince Thram in March. An official ceremony is scheduled to take place sometime in August. \
	In a short release to the press the Prince thanked S'rendarr, his uncle the King, and the marines and spacers who fought with him agianst Tartic. He vowed that his reign \
	will not abandon the sacred traditions of the New Kingdom but 'banish the darkness of Mesa that has clouded this kingdom for too long' and 'bring the Kingdom of Adhomai \
	into a new bright golden age within the light of the S'rendarr' and finally to 'spread that light to the far corners of the galaxy so all Tajara can bask in its glow!'. \

	The annoucement of Volink's appointment through only muted diplomatic reactions form galactic powers, however is rumors are to be believed the young prince is already making \
	alliances and with Nanotrasen. The Prince following his appointment annouced new trading arrangements with the company today perhaps making the New Kingdom the most Nanotrasen \
	friendly power on the face of Adhomai. However, this is not the unequal exploitative treaties Adhomai is used to. Diplomats have been shocked by the concessions Nanotrasen has given \
	in the deal. Whether this deal was simply a hard driven fluke or the start of a new age of cooperation between the Kingdom and megacorporations remains to be seen however for now \
	Nanotrasen is expected to take and train New Kingdom peasants as workers, skills that will no doubt aid in the development of the New Kingdom's archaic economy. Perhaps for once in \
	this kingdom out of time things are looking up, though with Nanotrasen involved one can only wonder the true price."

	is 183 terran years old, appeared in good health and uncharacteristically jovial at the celebration. Under his tenure Vey-Med has grown to be one of the largest \
	transtellar corporation in the known galaxy. Personally responsible for formalizing the company's alliance with Nanotrasen and for the creation of the wildly successful \
	Vey-Med Orion branch of the company Tel'barak has much to celebrate. At the height of the ceremony Tel'barak gave a speech celebrating the success of Vey-Med as a corporation, \
	admonish his critics, and deny the rumors of his failing health. \
	<br><br>\
	The speech was a stark reminders of the problems facing Vey-Med even with the startling successes of Tel'barak's tenure as CEO. Tel'barak's tenure though successful has many \
	critics. His alliance with Nanotrasen and Hephaestus Industries and the creation of Vey-Med Orion has in the eyes of many Vikarans corrupted the company with human ideals of \
	unrestrained capitalism. Outside of the regulated markets of the Vikara Combine the prices for Vey-Med care have been steadily rising over the past decades in a move that \
	many have criticized as the corporation cynically squeezing more revenue out of the needy. In addition Vey-Med Orion's shocking growth has brought many humans onto the board \
	of directors of the Vey-Med Corporation, among them Anwar Akhtar, Vey-Med's CFO and Tel'barak's personal protege. Having poached the young talent from Zheng-Hu, Tel'barak \
	has made Akhtar his closest confidant and greatest ally. For Tel'barak's critics Akhtar represents all the flaws of his tenure a human who has cynically pushed up the cost \
	of medicine for the sake of profit. Rumor has it that should Tel'barak die or retire Akhtar will inherit his shares of the company which will shift control of the company \
	away from Skrell board members and to the human newcomers. \
	<br><br>\
	Such a outcome seems unlikely for now at least. Tel'barak even in his advanced age seemed alive and quite well. This has not stopped people from speculating about his \
	potential failing health. Even with access to the best medical care possible, Tel'barak's public appearances have been less and less frequent while rumors abound that \
	Tel'barak is having to resort to ever more experimental medical techniques in order to prolong his life. The full extent of the treatments Tel'barak is undergoing is \
	considered highly classified information but in the past decades billions of thalers have been funneled into the quest for biological immortality often at the expense \
	of other research in the company. Obviously not without success as Tel'barak has far succeeded the natural lifespan of the Skrell and ranks among the oldest Skrell alive \
	today. What technology has ensured such a long life span remains a secret and as Tel'barak withdraws more and more from public life, the effectiveness of such technology \
	is increasingly in doubt. \
	<br><br>\
	The telling end of Tel'barak's speech was an toast to 75 more years of success under his tenure as CEO. With Vey-Med divided between Vikaran and Orion board members and after \
	75 years of Tel'barak's rule as CEO, a future without Tel'barak is harder to harder to see and his sudden death may prove the most challenging obstacle the company has faced in \
	decades."

	spaceships can be obtained at record low prices. \
	<br><br>\
	Whether this commercial prosperity can be maintained remains to be seen. The excesses of Fallman's Star are a hard pill to swallow for the Orion Confederation and many megacorps \

	as it was believed Morgan was to turn on them. Still the professional nature of the mercs suggest that those who arranged the attack payed top dollar and had access only to the \

	Vey-Med and Hephaestus Industries along with the Free Trade Union and Occulum News have survived Nanotrasen's aggressive cost cutting strategy. The cuts come after repeated revenue misses \
	by Nanotrasen in recent financial quarters which has led NT to beginning cutting unnecessary expenses. Many experts believe that this will not result \
	in a great loss in manpower for the company as many contractors have been offered positions within Nanotrasen, however it yet another sign of the persistent financial troubles \
	Nanotrasen has faced following the loss of its Phoron monopoly. \
	<br><br>\
	Nanotrasen has ensured its investors that the cuts to the contractors do not represent a decline in revenue expectations and that intends to double down on its relationships \
	with its remaining partners, strengthening ties to Vey-Med and Hephaestus while pursuing deeper relations with The Free Trade Union and Occulum News. Investors remained unconvinced \
	and Nanotrasen's stock drop 2% the next day at the Orion Stock Exchange following the annoucement of the cuts. Inside sources state that the financial situation with Nanotrasen remains \
	worse then the company claims and that Nanotrasen may begin aggressively cutting expenses in order to raise profits. Nanotrasen for its matter remains commited to its \
	research and discovery focused strategy and continues its ambitions to search the galaxy for the next phoron or bluespace crystal hoping that once more, a radical scientific \
	breakthrough can propel the company to new heights. Whether lightning will strike thrice for Nanotrasen remains to be seen, but for now the company's financial fate remains \
	up the air."

	data = "Today the Orion Legion confirmed reports from across the frontier that xenomorph colonies were undergoing a mass metamorphosis. The newly evolved xenos seem to \
	be trading longevity for strenght and power with the new forms resembling the warforms that Orion Forces faced during the last great Xenomorph incursion into Orion space. \
	The Orion Legion fears that the mass evolutionary event possibly set off by a galaxy spanning morphogenic signal, could signal that the xenos are once more ready to  \
	go on the offensive in their war against all life in the galaxy. These 'warform xenomorphs' have already begun assaulting SDF positions across the frontier using their \
	superior forms and specializations to overwhelm SDF formation used to dealing with less dangerous 'colony xenomorphs'. Thankfully the Orion Legion's xenofighting expertise has \
	not waned in years since the last big incursion and the Legion has updated their publically avaiable tactical guide to fighting xenomorphs. \
	<br><br>\
	The remainder of the Orion Legion press release detailed the particular warforms that SDF and others are now expected to deal with. Of note, the Line Breaker Xenomorphs have \
	made a comeback with the warforms presenting a trouble to SDF forces who lack the ammunition to crack the shells of these rhino like xenomorphs. In addition the return of \
	War Monarchs has been confirmed. These warform xenomorph royals are far from the overgrown egg layers of their colony cousions. Capable of fighting even armored vehicles \
	only the most prepared SDF teams have any chance of taking one down even without her hive backing her up. Marksman Acid spitters have also been confirmed and existing acid \
	spitters have begun to release a more potent blend of acid. More specialized warforms are for now absent though the Orion Legion expects them to begin appearing in the coming \
	weeks. The Legion advises you report any xenomorph activity to the local SDF immediately, when it comes to fighting xenos hours can mean the difference between a minor incident \
	and a major outbreak that kills thousands. Keep alert out there everyone just because they have been beaten before does not mean they don't pose a threat now. \
	<br><br>\
	Occulum News Network will provide updates on major xenomorph activity on its local stations be sure to tune in so you can be alerted to the latest developments."

	data = "Terrible news from the frontier. A hivebot cluster has managed to salvage tech from the precursor 'Abductor' species and its central intelligence has managed \
	to integrate itself with an Abductor AI. This new intelligence reportedly goes by the designation ENIGMA and has rapidly assembled an army of new synthetic warriors \
	based on Abductor technology. These dangerous combat units are said to be humanoids and armed with advanced energy weapons. Capable of easily matching the combat \
	potential of even military personnel these ENIGMA drones are now on a quest to secure Abductor technology by any means neccessary exterminating anyone who dare \
	oppose their quest to recover Abductor artifacts. \
	<br><br>\
	Details regarding the exact strength of the ENIGMA forces is unknown however the AI has already stuck at multiple abductor archaelogical sites across the frontier. \
	Survivors describe ENIGMA as ultilizing a large about of humanoid drones armed with energy weapons supported by larger humanoids resembling light mechs. The heavier \
	units are said to make use or personal sheild generators to protect them from attacks. Some units resemble floating spheres where leader units resemble floating squids \
	using a form of antigravity technology to sustain flight. The squid like drones have been confirmed to be commanders of the drones. Nanotrasen and Necropolis security \
	teams have been among the first to engage with the forces having been barely able to hold them back but managing to deny Enigma the capture of some Abductor Artifacts. \

	Local governments and SDFs are preparing contigencies to deal to the new ENIGMA threat. Please contact your local governments for more information about the threat \

	name = "ENIGMA AI Deploys Nanite Soldiers in Bloody Search for Abductor Technology! What Other Horrors Could Await? - 9/10/2568"
	data = "Today Frontier the Orion Legion published its latest intelligence on the ENIGMA AI and its reign of terror across the frontier. Shocking the audience \
	it showed live footage of what was identified as a Nanite soldier attacking SDF patrols. The footage taken from shuttle craft shows the blade armed nanite monstrosity \
	cut through the SDF forces, apparently teleporting through SDF fire to close the distant between it and the soldiers. The footage closes when SDF command orders an air-strike \
	upon the nanite drone who had just finished off the last of the patrol. The Orion Legion, Nanotrasen, and the Blackstar Legion have together dubbed the new drone as a \
	'Banshee' and confirmed that this was not a unique drone and that addition versions of this nanite assassin droid can be expected to be fought wherever ENIGMA forces \
	can be found. \
	<br><br>\
	The Banshee is a stark wakeup call for the Orion Confederation and militaries of the galaxy at large. Nanite weapons have been a matter of theory before, with development \
	being largely banned due to the dangers posed by grey goo swarms or nanite plagues. Though nanite synthetics already exist in the form of proteans, such a clear weaponization of \
	nanite technology is a stark reminder of how dangerous such technology. For the Orion Legion and corporate intelligence offices this only underlies the importance of developing \
	countermeasures to nanite weaponry and countering the ENIGMA threat. The Orion Legion at the end of their presentation stated that they would be designating additional ships \
	into tracking and surpressing ENIGMA presence, however with the Orion Legion already stretched so thin across the Frontier it is unlikely this allocation will have a signifcant \
	effect. Frontier powers and corporation will likely have to bear the brunt of the fight against ENIGMA which is bitter pill both in terms of financial burdern and in lives lost. \

	name = "Six Dead After Breaking into World War 3 Nuclear Disposal Site on Earth! Could Other Atomic Graves Be Unearthed? - 10/3/2568"
	data = "Tragedy struck in Old Russian territories of Earth when a group of young adults somehow managed to breach a storage site for the nuclear debris left behind by the \
	Third World War. Somehow the breach managed to remain undetected until monitoring equipment picked up a sharp spike in radiation levels from the site. When a team was \
	dispatched to investigate it they discover the bodies of 6 young men and women ages 31 to 22, whose identities are to remain confidential out of respect to their families. \
	The youths somehow managed to disturb the carefully stored nuclear waste releasing a lethal dose of radiation. The bodies of the youth's were found with burns and bruises \
	across their bodies suggesting extreme exposure to radiation. It is believed that after being exposed to radiation the youths began to hallucinate as the radiation ravaged \
	their minds attacking eachother before their deaths. Due to the extreme radioactive contaming of their bodies the victims will not be cremated and instead they will be \
	sealed in lead caskets and buried in another secure site for atomic waste. Hopefully this grim reminder of the dangers of nuclear waste can prevent a tragedy like this \
	from ever happening again. \
	<br><br> \
	Yet still the fact that this tragedy was even allowed to happen has outraged many. Both Earth citizens and government officials are demanding answers on what sort of negligence \
	allowed the waste site to be breached, how the teens were not detected and how such active waste was left so easily accessible. The answers for now are few but a trusted \
	anonymous source for Occulum News claims that the site had been dealing with electronic issues for years now. Problems can be traced all the way back to early 2565. It appears \
	that despite having advanced security and detection equipment the site was plagued with malfunctions. Site workers blame these malfunctions on a as of yet unexplained increase \
	in radioactivity over the past few years. Some experts believe that the containers used to store the radioactive material have begun failing thousands of years earlier then expected. \
	What is clear though is that on the night of the breach the site's seucrity system underwent some sort of critical error which left the gate wide open for the six victims \
	that would die later that night. \
	<br><br> \
	Much remains unanswered, such as why there was such a critical spike in radiation following the breach by the six victims. No incidence of criticality is even thought possible \
	with waste so thoroughly decayed. Experts currently debate whether the radiation spike was caused by some incredibly improbably criticality incident or whether it is possible \
	that the half-lives of the material stored at the site need to be recalculated under the special circumstances of the waste's storage. Additional questions remain as to what \
	to do with the waste still stored at the site and other sites across Earth. Do existing containment sites need to be reinforced? Do new containment sites need to be \
	constructed to account for the new challenges in waste disposal? Is it possible to dispose of the waste off planet without risking lives and health during transit? \
	These are the questions Earth's governments are asking themselves right now. What remains certain though is no one wants anything like this to happen again."

	name = "Xenomorphs Hegemony Border Space! Hegemony Forces Fight Off Xenowarforms! - 11/3/2568"
	data = "Two months ago the Orion Legion warned of a mass evolution of xenomorphs across the galaxy, with colony xenomorphs evolving into more dangerous warforms and \
	becoming far more aggressive. Today reports came in from the border with the Three Hands Hegemony of just how widespread the xeno problem has gotten. The Three Hands \
	gave official reports today of ongoing military operations against xenomorphs in Hegemony Border regions. According to the Moghesian representative the Hegemony became \
	aware of the scale of the problem when the independently owned Andromeda Haven space station was destroyed during a Xenomorph attack. Since then the Hegemony has launched \
	a counter attack destroyed xeno infested ships and asteroids across their border in order to keep the region secure. Casaulties are allegedly minimal save for Andromeda \
	Haven which was reportedly lost with all hands. \
	<br><br> \
	The full scale of the xenomorph assault is yet to be determined as the scale of the Hegemony's military operations is restricted information. What is known is that it appears \
	the destruction of Adromeda Haven greatly slowed the incursion of Xenomorphs into the region. The Hegemony's military did confirm that specialized combat xenomorphs \
	were among the ones slain by Hegemony's QRF. Kamekaze Burster Xenomorphs, Fiery Inferno Xenomorphs and even Beserks were confirmed slain by the Hegemony. This only confirms \
	the Orion Legion;s earlier prediction of the spread of the specialist xenomorphs across the galaxy. With xenomorph attacks becomes more and more sophisticated many wonder \
	if some sort of major Xenomorph invasion is on the horizon and where it could be. Others fear that this evolution is the beginning of a new normal with the xenomorphs \
	and that sporadic attacks like this one could become commonplace across the cosmos. \
	<br><br> \
	Please make sure to report any xenomorph activity to your local SDF. Follow local Occulum News Network channels for reports on Xenomorph activity in your area."
