	name = "Nanotrasen Acquires Three Systems from People's Republic of Adhomai! Insult to revolution or savy political move? -  6/19/2563"
	data = "Today Nanotrasen announced that is had purchased three systems from the People's Republic of Adhomai (PRA), a move widely mocked by the Republic's rivals on Adhomai.\
	The three systems Lythios-43, Miaphus, and Motov were 'settled' as penal colonies in the late 2530's and early 2540's. Since the three systems have been a drain on the \
	resources of the PRA as the meagre mines and resources of the three systems along with their meagre forced laborer population could not hope to cover the costs of maintaining \
	the distant colonies. The final straw came for the colonies when in 2557 a experimental reactor in a weapons testing facility on Lythios-43c suffered a catastrophic meltdown.\
	With hundreds injured and dozens dead from the meltdown, the PRA vowed to close the facility and in 2560 the Lythios last Tajaran personelle left Lythios-43c abandoning the system.\
	<br><br>\
	Shortly after, the PRA entered negotations with Nanotrasen over the rights to the three systems after similar high profile disasters occured in Miaphus and Motov systems.\
	The deal was made public last week, when documents detailing the arrangement were leaked to the independent press on Adhomai by anonamous source. In total, Nanotrasen has \
	acquired the two colonies Miaphus'irra, a scorching desert world, and Motov'maal, an icy planet witha subterraiian ocean respectively, various outposts within the Motov,\
	Miaphus and Lythios-43 systems, along with the esimtated fifty thousand ajaran penal colonists within. Nanotrasen has vowed to turn the colonies into prosperous frontier societies,\
	freeing the former laborers and offering them all gainful employment within the company.\
	<br><br>\
	On Adhomai however the sale has been met with mass mockery. The New Kingdom of Adhomai and Democratic Republic of Adhomai have both issued scathing criticism of the PRA \
	mocking their lack of commitment to the revolutionary values they claim to strive for not only selling their planets to foriegners but a foriegn megacorporation.\
	The media on Adhomai aside from PRA controlled channels have given non-stop coverage of the incident which has provided almost endless fodder for the comedians across \
	the snowy hoemworld of the Tajaran people. The PRA in response annouce their 'partnership' with Nanotrasen relating to the system earlier today in a blatant attempt to \
	save face.\
	<br><br>\
	Nanotrasen for its part has begun preparing to take over the facilities they ahve purchased from the PRA. One of its first priorities and part of the original deal with the PRA \
	is to take some measures to clean up the still heavily radioactive remains of the reactor site of Lythios-43c Nanotrasen considers the world a top priority for resource expoitation \
	and study and are eager to repurpose the remanents of the Tajaran base their into yet another of their countless surface bases. Similarly it hopes to ressume production on the mines \
	of Miaphus'irra and improve the aquaponics and geothermal facilities on Motov'maal, hoping to turn the former penal colonies around in a positive way.\

	data = "The quiet independent asteroid mining station of Rzhavoye-Zoloto suffered a massive tragedy when miners salvaging an unidentified derelict, \
	accidentally released a sample of Fungal Tuberculois into the ventilation systems of the station. The genetically engineered fungus quickly \
	spread through the vents infecting dozens before the station's Chief Engineer disabled the ventilation systems an action which is thought to \
	have saved possibly hundreds of lives. Still even with its spread quickly contained, and the quick response of station medical staff quarantining \
	infected areas and individuals, the infection was still able to kill thirty and infect thrice that number. A Vey-Med quick response force was able \
	to arrive within 48 hours of the distress signal being received from the station. The Vey-Med team equipped specifically to deal with deadly outbreaks \
	was able to adminster anti-fungal drugs to the surviving crew and cleanse infected areas. They are expected to release an all clear by the end of the week. \
	The Orion Confederation has suspened the mining operations of Rzhavoye-Zoloto for the immediate future while it dispatches a team to comb the region for \
	any additional Syndicate assets still hidden in the belt, hoping to make sure that no addition Nuclear Biological or Chemical weapons are hidden in the region. \
	<br><br>\
	Fungal Tuberculois was developed by new defunct Cybersun Industries at the height of the Syndicate's war on Nanotrasen. The fungus, whose offical name has \
	been likely intentionally lost by its creators, was designed to infect station and starsghip ventilation systems rapidly spreading itself to an entire crew \
	undetected. Infected individuals would rapidly develop symptoms similar to late stage tuberculois infections. Victims often die coughing up blood as the fungus \
	rapidly eats away at their lungs. Cybersun and its Syndicate allies would often deploy the bioweapon on targets covertly shortly before launching boarding \
	actions in hopes to seize vessels, stations or thier cargos. Though initially highly effective, Nanotrasen's own medical staff was able to rise against this \
	new threat and was able to devise an effective antifungal treatment in a matter of months since the first reports of the infection. Unfortunately the rapid \
	spread of the fungal infection and its quick lethality meant that many stations were often crippled by the infection and countless NT employess died \
	before Cybersun ultimately moved its remaining stockpile of Fungal Tuberculois and its dispersal device into storage shortly a few years before Cybersun \
	Industries and the Syndicate dissolved entirely signaling an end to the phoron wars. \
	<br><br>\
	Since that time incidents like the tragedy on Rzhavoye-Zoloto have not been entirely unheard of. Cybersun's rapid dissolution alongside the collapse of its \
	allies such as Gorlex Manufacturing Corporation, saw countless stockpiles of Syndicate weaponry even their well guarded Nuclear Biological and Chemical weapon \
	stockpiles disappear, as they were either hidden, destroyed, sold or perhaps even simply forgotten about. With the spread of Nanotrasen's antifungal counter \
	to the old bioweapon and Zeng-Hu Pharmaceutical's incorporation of similarly effective anti-fungal agents into their own mass market antifungal drugs, \
	deaths from Fungal Tuberculois are now thankfully rare, and with fewer and fewer samples floating about the galaxy, many hope that this grim \
	reminder of the phoron wars will soon only exist in labortories."

	data = "With the frontier colonies being more spread out as ever, Piracy is growing rampart in those territories. While Megacorporations such as NanoTrasen, \
	Hepastheus and even Necropolis Industries might protect certain trade routes neccessary for their continued prosperity, it was always assumed that \
	the three major Galactic powers, that being the Orion Confederacy, Moghes Hegemony and Vikara Combine, will protect that major hyperspace routes from dangers. \
	That, however, has been proven not to be the case. \
	<br><br>\
	In recent days there was a major spike in Pirate activity on lanes connecting Orion Confederacy and it's frontiers, as well as the Hegemony and the Combine. \
	With the amount of pirate raids increasing, most free traders do not dare cross the Temhöser gate, the so called 'bottleneck' in Hyperlanes leading into \
	the Hegemony from Galactic south or follow the ill-protected Eastern Highways into the Vikara Combine. \
	<br><br>\
	It was reported by many of our readers in the Western frontier that a large group of pirates has made their camp right outside the Temhöser gate, \
	awaiting any ship to approach the nearest re-fueling station just to strike them unaware. Moghes Hegemony advises all traders and travellers to choose the \
	longer, yet more protected, route going near the galactic core if they want to reach their trade ports. \
	<br><br>\
	Orion Confederacy and Vikara Combine are promising that they will combine their available forces into a Joint Operations team to hunt down \
	any pirate fleets camping near the galactic highways, however our anonymous contact within Combine Armed Forces suggests that said \
	operation will not be ready until early 2567. \
	<br><br>\
	And for those curious about the Hegemony response, the Naramadi Ascendancy has put out a statement after they suffered a major blow - loss of \
	Inkinira viator Galvus and the Council of Elders for House Galvus.  The statement is as follows:\
	<br>\
	'The despicable actions of pirates preying on unprepared vessels attempting to enter and leave the Hegemony space have never been our point of focus, \
	until they have decided to take something dear to us, Inkinira viator Galvus, a beloved Matriarch, Mother to many and the eldest viator this landsmeet \
	had the honour to host. As only aggression has been shown to us, We will respond in kind. The Third and Sixth fleets are being mobilised, together with \
	the Fifth and Sixth legions. We will not stop untill her killers are brought to justice.'\
	<br><br>\
	The response of the Naramadi Ascendancy was called '... A show of power, and a poor one at that' by the Confederacy high command, and the Moghes Kingdoms \
	offer no official military support, however they reportedly allow 'volunteers' to join the Fleets in their quest to hunt down the pirates. \
	<br><br>\
	In closing words, We need to expect price increases in various luxury goods and raw materials coming from outside the Orion Confederacy. With piracy on the rise, \
	not many traders and transport corporations are willing to risk loosing their ships, and cargo, in wild space, and those that do often raise their prices to be \
	able to pay for their security staff."
