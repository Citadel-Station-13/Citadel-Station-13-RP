## Balancing Guidelines

Here's some rough costs in whatever money unit of choice the lore team has bikeshedded the codebase to in a given year.

- Remember that 'worth' is both a buy and a sell price.

### clothing

- basic clothing (e.g. bland jumpsuits, gray satchels) should be no more than 5-10 
- branded clothing should be 25-75
- 'luxury' / rare clothing can be any value you want.

### armor

armor can be anywhere from 150 to well over 1000 for a full set depending on functions

- light 100-250
- medium 200-600
- heavy 350-1000+
- specialized 250-1000+

spacesuits are function-dependent; follow armor guidelines with baseline being medium.

- rigsuits specifically should be a bit more expensive than the voidsuit equivalent
- rigsuits should take into account weight / slots / etc limitations.

### equipment

- basic tools should be no more than 5-10
- advanced tools (powertools+) should be around the 30-50 range
- specialized tools (rcds, etc) should be around the 100-400 range, depending on function
