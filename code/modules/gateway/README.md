# Gateway Module

WIP module for a series of disjunct mechanics for shunting people across spaces.

- These are unrelated to telescience module, and therefore will not be balanced by it nor will it be constructible.
- These are mostly for map design, admin spawn, and events.

## Contains

- Stargates: Classic SS13 gateways with rudimentary accuracy/precision and destination settings
- Quantum Archways: See-through & Walk-through 'line' gateways
