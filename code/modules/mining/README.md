# Mining

Mining is split into:

1. Excavation - horizontal, clicking on stuff with ~~weapons~~ mining tools.
2. Drilling - vertical, setting drills up on things.

They're for our two types of players (cookie clicker / pvp addicts, and roleplayers).

## Lore Notes

Things like the Kinetic Accelerator and similar are attributed to certain factions but are not exclusive.

If something isn't in `code/game/content/*` for a specific faction and **labelled as such**, it's a generic item.

As an example, the kinetic accelerator is a Nanotrasen creation but it's old as heck and has probably been leaked over to literally everyone and re-mixed a thousand times by now.
