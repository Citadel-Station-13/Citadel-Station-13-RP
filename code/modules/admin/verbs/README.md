# Admin Verbs

Admin verbs should only be made for absolute necessity.

BYOND verbs are bad. Secrets panel entries, and verbs that open full panels are much more preferred.

Verbs are justified for;

- right click context menu needs (rejuvenate, select equipment, view variables)
- very common actions (delete, spawn)
- low-level debug backends (sdql, restart controller)

If in doubt, it shouldn't be a verb.
