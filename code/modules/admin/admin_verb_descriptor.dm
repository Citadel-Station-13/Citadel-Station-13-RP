 * Describes an admin verb.
 *
 * When admin verbs should be used:
 * * Core debug functions (VV, SDQL, similar). These should **never** be abstracted to complex
 *   systems like TGUI, as we need thse to debug said complex systems!
 * * Anything that invokes on right click
 * * Anything that is very simple to invoke ('spawn') and is used enough that removing it
 *   for a panel makes no sense as it would make the lives of people using the in-game
 *   command line worse!
