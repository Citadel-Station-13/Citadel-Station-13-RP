	/**
	 * explanation on why current and next are done:
	 *
	 * projectiles track their pixel x/y on turf, not absolute pixel x/y from edge of map
	 * this is done to make it simpler to reason about, but is not necessarily the most simple
	 * or efficient way to do things.
	 *
	 * part of the problems with this approach is that Move() is not infallible. the projectile can be blocked.
	 * if we immediately set current pixel x/y, if the projectile is intercepted by a Bump, we now dont' know the 'real'
	 * position of the projectile because it's out of sync with where it should be
	 *
	 * now, things that require math operations on it don't know the actual location of the projectile until this proc
	 * rolls it back
	 *
	 * so instead, we never touch current px/py until the move is known to be successful, then we set it
	 * to the stored next px/py
	 *
	 * this way, things accessing can mutate our state freely without worrying about needing to handle rollbacks
	 *
	 * this entire system however adds overhead
	 * if we want to not have overhead, we'll need to rewrite hit processing and have it so moves are fully illegal to fail
	 * but doing that is literally not possible because anything can reject a move for any reason whatsoever
	 * and we cannot control that, so, instead, we make projectiles track in absolute pixel x/y coordinates from edge of map
	 *
	 * that way, we don't even need to care about where the .loc is, we just know where the projectile is supposed to be by
	 * knowing where it isn't, and by taking the change in its pixels the projectile controller can tell the projectile
	 * where to go-
	 *
	 * (all shitposting aside, this is for future work; it works right now and we have an API to do set angle, kick forwards, etc)
	 * (so i'm not going to touch this more because it's 4 AM and honestly this entire raycaster is already far less overhead)
	 * (than the old system of a 16-loop of brute forced 2 pixel increments)
