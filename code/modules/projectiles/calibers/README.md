# Calibers

All specific calibers go in here. In their own files.

No more 1200 line b/s.

Put the magazines / casings / etc together; if projectiles were specially made for it, put it there too.

Calibers should be named 'a12g' for say, '12g', as most programming languages do not allow leading numbers in identifiers.

If a magazine only is meant to work for one specific gun, put it with the gun instead.
