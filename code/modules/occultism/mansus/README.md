# Occultism - The Mansus 

remix of /tg/station heretics.

while the code is written in-house, the majority of sprite & idea credits goes to them; this is an awesome antagonist.

## wait why is it called mansus

because i like greebling everything and i'm satan, Too Bad.

(non joke answer: we might have multiple implementations of occult stuff, and this is Legally Not The Same as /tg/ heretics.)
