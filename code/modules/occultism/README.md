# Occultism Module

This isn't really a module as much as a collection of modules containing more magic/fantasy-themed things than the usual sci-fi.

* The Clockwork Cult, once implemented, will **not** go in here. It will be aligned with the xenoarcheology (sci-fi) system.

## Design Notes - Descriptions

Obfuscation is done on purpose much of the time. 'name' and 'desc' is what an average layperson can see.

An average layperson doesn't know a null-rod, for example, is 'anti-magic'. It's literally a rod of obsidian; you don't even know it won't shatter if you use it as a weapon. In-fact, why *does* it not shatter when you do that?
