# Occultism - Geometer Module

Home of the blood cult. Also remixed from /tg/station (duh).

The Blood Cult is a collective (read: the deity owns you) cult that's pretty much 
hell-bent on breaching the barriers between dimensions to allow their owning deity
to break into realspace and start marking territory.
