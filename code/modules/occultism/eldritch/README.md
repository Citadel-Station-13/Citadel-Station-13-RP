# Occultism - Eldritch Module

remix of /tg/station heretics.

while the code is written in-house, the majority of sprite & idea credits goes to them; this is an awesome antagonist.

## wait why is it called eldritch

because i like greebling everything and i'm satan, Too Bad.

(non joke answer: we might have multiple implementations of occult stuff, and this is Legally Not The Same as /tg/ heretics.)

## What is this?

The Eldritch module contains eldritch cult mechanics and their patrons.

This is an individualistic role-like system; unlike the Blood Cult (/occultism/geometer), this is more of someone making a pact with an entity rather than someone declaring fealty and being tempered by a single malevolent deity.
