	//? it's weird to have region and type without a 2d array huh

	//? there's almost no cases where you want to grant type edit
	//? without region edit, or that you'd grant only partial type edit
	//? it's almost impossible to need more than 24 regions unless
	//? we somehow get more than 20 departments, since
