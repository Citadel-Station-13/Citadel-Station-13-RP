//* Clickchain Flags *//

/**
 * flags passed around click procs including but not limited to:
 * ClickOn
 * melee_interaction_chain
 * ranged_interaction_chain
 * attackby
 * pre_attack
 * standard_melee_attack and related
 * attack_mob and related
 * attack_obj and related
 * afterattack
 * MouseDrop
 * OnMouseDrop
 * MouseDroppedOn
 *
 * * These are default-additive. This means that most of the time, these all combine as we go down the chain without being
 *   reset.

// todo: these flags are somewhat weird; infact, most of them are somewhat awful and need to be redone.
//       as an example, DO_NOT_PROPAGATE started as a "this thing's deleted, please stop engaging with it"
//       and an immediate abort.
//
//       but what if we want to communicate "hey, we did something, stop doing more things"?
//       example: screwdriver is usually used for construction but something wanted to override it
//       so it says "we're done here". that became the DID_SOMETHING flag, which is checked
//       for 'interaction continue'.
//
//       that, however, has its own issues. what if we want something triggering at end of
//       clickchain that reacts based on data? we want to differentiate between
//       1. "we were deleted but the user touched the entity",
//       2. "action completed but we were taken away / moved out of user",
//       3. "action halted by user when they realized they can't do something"
//          (e.g. "you don't have enough money to insert it into the vendor")
//       4. "action completed and the user wants to stop now but actually touched the entity"
//       5. "we were deleted but the user **did not** touch the entity"
//
//       this might all seem like semantics but if we ever add generic components that
//       need to hook on **any** contact of an item with an entity, this'll be needed.
//       door charges like the old /tg/ item are an example; we want it to engage on any contact,
//       not just on open.
