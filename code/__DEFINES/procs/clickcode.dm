//! Clickchain Flags
/**
 * flags passed around click procs including:
 * ClickOn
 * melee_attack_chain
 * ranged_attack_chain
 * attackby
 * pre_attack
 * standard_melee_attack and related
 * attack_mob and related
 * attack_obj and related
 * afterattack
 * MouseDrop
 * OnMouseDrop
 * MouseDroppedOn
 *
 * These are *not* used for attack_hand, attack_robot, attack_xeno, and similar clicked-by-specific-mob attack procs.
 * These are also not used for attack_self, as that isn't even a true clickcode proc.
