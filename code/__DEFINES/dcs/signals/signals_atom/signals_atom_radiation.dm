//! STOP. Are you about to add RAD_PROBE?
//! Well, don't. Add a trait system to manage rad_flags & RAD_BLOCK_CONTENTS, because
//! that's all it does, and there's literally no point in sending arg-less signals!
//! If we ever decide to make the signal have an arg, then yes, feel free to. For now, DON'T.
