/**
 * Create the 4 standard subtypes for a given turf type.
 *
 * * Indoors uses indoors gas mix of level, and is indoors.
 * * Outdoors uses outdoors gas mix of level, and is outdoors.
 * * Inherit-Area inherits the gas mix and outdoors status of the area.
 * * Overhang uses outdoors gas mix of level, and is indoors.
 *
 * This macro allows for annotating the type being processed by commenting above.
 * This macro acts like the type it's generating when writing prototype overrides below.
