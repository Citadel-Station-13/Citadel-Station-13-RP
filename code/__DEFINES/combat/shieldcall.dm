//* The shieldcall system is a very low-level 'damage instance' interception API. *//
//* It's used by the shieldcalls list in atoms to perform low-level intercepts,   *//
//* as well as by default features like armor to perform their damage intercepts. *//
//*                                                                               *//
//* For speed reasons, shieldcalls pass a single argument list down instead of    *//
//* returning new lists every call, as shieldcalls need to be able to edit many   *//
//* facets of a damage instance.                                                  *//

//*
//* Adding new arguments should be done sparingly.
//* Removing arguments requires every single proc with SHIELDCALL_PROC_HEADER     *//
//* to be audited.                                                                *//
