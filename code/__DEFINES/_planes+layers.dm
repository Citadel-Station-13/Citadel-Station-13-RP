/**
 *! This file is a list of all preclaimed planes & layers
 *
 * All planes & layers should be given a value here instead of using a magic/arbitrary number.
 *
 * After fiddling with planes and layers for some time, I figured I may as well provide some documentation:
 *
 *? What are planes?
 *  - Think of Planes as a sort of layer for a layer - if plane X is a larger number than plane Y, the highest number for a layer in X will be below the lowest
 *  - number for a layer in Y.
 *  - Planes also have the added bonus of having planesmasters.
 *
 *? What are Planesmasters?
 *  - Planesmasters, when in the sight of a player, will have its appearance properties (for example, colour matrices, alpha, transform, etc)
 *  - applied to all the other objects in the plane. This is all client sided.
 *  - Usually you would want to add the planesmaster as an invisible image in the client's screen.
 *
 *? What can I do with Planesmasters?
 *  - You can: Make certain players not see an entire plane,
 *  - Make an entire plane have a certain colour matrices,
 *  - Make an entire plane transform in a certain way,
 *  - Make players see a plane which is hidden to normal players - I intend to implement this with the antag HUDs for example.
 *  - Planesmasters can be used as a neater way to deal with client images or potentially to do some neat things
 *
 *? How do planes work?
 *  - A plane can be any integer from -100 to 100. (If you want more, bug lummox.)
 *  - All planes above 0, the 'base plane', are visible even when your character cannot 'see' them, for example, the HUD.
 *  - All planes below 0, the 'base plane', are only visible when a character can see them.
 *
 *? How do I add a plane?
 *  - Think of where you want the plane to appear, look through the pre-existing planes and find where it is above and where it is below
 *  - Slot it in in that place, and change the pre-existing planes, making sure no plane shares a number.
 *  - Add a description with a comment as to what the plane does.
 *
 *? How do I make something a planesmaster?
 *  - Add the PLANE_MASTER appearance flag to the appearance_flags variable.
 *
 *? What is the naming convention for planes or layers?
 *  - Make sure to use the name of your object before the _LAYER or _PLANE, eg: [NAME_OF_YOUR_OBJECT HERE]_LAYER or [NAME_OF_YOUR_OBJECT HERE]_PLANE
 *  - Also, as it's a define, it is standard practice to use capital letters for the variable so people know this.
 *
 *
 * For easy recordkeeping; these are BYOND defines.
