/**
 * Obfuscation module
 *
 * * Generates **mangled** IDs; these are either persistently-unique or round-local IDs that are separate per map / map template.
 * * Generates **obfuscated** IDs; these are mangled and obfuscated IDs that are safe to reveal to players.
 *
 * Mangling keys are based on the **load instance** the mapping subsystem is in.
 * * It is crucial to call these ID transformation procs during preloading_instance(), not Initialize().
 * * It is usually already too late by the time Initialize() fires.
 * * By default, /datum/map (not /datum/map_level), /datum/map_template, /datum/shuttle_template are the three things that form new mangling boundaries/contexts.
