/*
This is pretty much just an optimization for wait=0 timers. They're relatively common, but generally don't actually need the more
 complex features of SStimer. SSdpc can handle these timers instead (and it's a lot simpler than SStimer is), but it can't handle
 complex timers with flags. This doesn't need to be explicitly used, eligible timers are automatically converted.
