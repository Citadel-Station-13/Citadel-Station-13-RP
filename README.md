This is the codebase for the CitadelRP flavoured fork of SpaceStation 13.

Citadel Station 13 RP, also known as CitadelRP was originally a fork of VOREStation, which separated on 01/25/2019.

## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation

On **May 9, 2022** we have changed the way to compile the codebase.

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building CitadelRP in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.

## SQL Setup

The SQL backend for the library and stats tracking requires a MySQL server.
Your server details go in /config/legacy/dbconfig.txt, and the SQL schema is in /SQL/tgstation_schema.sql.
More detailed setup instructions arecoming soon, for now ask in our Discord.
