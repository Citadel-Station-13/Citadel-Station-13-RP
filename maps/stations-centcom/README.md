# Central Command Maps

While the idea of 'central command' is silly in Citadel RP lore as is, for codebase reasons we still have the hierarchy of 'station', 'centcom', and 'offmaps'.

We're trying to move away from this; but for the time being, these are all the useable CentCom maps.

They're currently hard-bound to the station using them, but eventually we'll move to a hot-pluggable system.
