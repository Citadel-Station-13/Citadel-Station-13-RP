//The snowfields are a wide open field coated in a blanket of snow, contains no caves, and is dangerous without proper heat insulation and armor.
//POIs here spawn in two different sections, the points marked far and the points marked near, which the map file details.
//The right side of the map is marked 'far', while the shuttle and left side is marked near.
//'Near' will be less threatening than 'far' and will have more passive mobs, but will still allow spawns to occur close to the LZ.
//'Far' will have more dangerous mob spawns, as well as larger and more rewarding POIs.
