	info = "Hello! <br><br> If you are reading this, you are attempting to activate the back up supply generators for an Endeavour Class vessel! <br><br>Please take note! Distribute the fuel among four or more generators, and be sure to leave them connected to each other via the breakers! This ships is divided into power zones, rather than departmental power subgrids. Powering the generators and leaving them connected to the secondary net will combine the power of all the generators and power the ship via this combined effort. If part of the ship is damaged, and you need to get power up to your section of the ship, *then* disconnect your area of interest. <br><br> Thank you for reading, and have a secure day!"
