	info = "This is one of the oldest vessel of the fleet. Started off as a luxury yacht, with 3 decks, that carried NT VIPs and celebrity. When the corporate wars broke out, the vessel was fast enough to serve as a blockade runner. In this mode, all external windows are blocked off. The ballista and the whole 4th Deck was added too respond to the growing tensions. After the wars, the Strelka was often used to clear out paths for the Marksman fleet."
