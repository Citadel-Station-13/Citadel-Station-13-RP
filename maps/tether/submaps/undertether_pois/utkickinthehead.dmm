Apparently the person taking the test is suppose to choose the phrase that most resembles the inkblot in question. The third inkblot on the list has had its answers crossed out and crudely written in it's place is the phrase "Two Bears High-fiving". Examing the blot yourself, you cannot shake its resemblance to "Two BEars High-Fiving".[/i];
